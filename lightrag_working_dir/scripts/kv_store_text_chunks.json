This period witnessed the transformation of fleeting visual experiments into the foundations of a global entertainment industry, shaped by both the marvel of moving images and the often-cutthroat business practices designed to control this new medium.\nTechnological Roots: Motion and Vision Experiments\nThe concept of projecting moving images for entertainment predates the late 19th century, with devices like magic lanterns, which used hand-manipulated glass slides, and the Phenakistiscope, a spinning disc that simulated movement, having been popular for generations.1 More direct precursors to cinema emerged from experiments in capturing and replaying motion. Photographer Eadweard Muybridge, famously settling a bet for Leland Stanford about whether a galloping horse ever had all four hooves off the ground, developed the Zoopraxiscope in 1879. This device projected a series of images, captured by multiple cameras, to recreate movement.1 Concurrently, in Paris, physiologist Etienne-Jules Marey advanced this field with his \"photographic gun\" or chronophotography, capable of taking 12 pictures per second with a single camera, a significant step towards a unified motion picture device.2\nThe practical and cost-effective breakthrough that would heavily influence subsequent motion picture technology came from Thomas Edison's laboratory. While Edison conceived the idea of a device that would \"do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear\" 1, much of the crucial experimental work was performed by his assistant, William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, aided initially by Charles A. Brown and later by William Heise.1 Their initial experiments for what became the Kinetograph camera were based on Edison's phonograph cylinder, attempting to affix tiny photographic images in sequence.1 A pivotal development was the adoption of George Eastman's flexible celluloid roll film, which provided a more durable and practical medium than earlier paper or glass plates.1 Dickson and Heise developed a camera using this film, initially with a horizontal-feed mechanism, which was later changed to a vertical feed for the Kinetoscope, the peephole viewing device completed around 1892.1 The Kinetoscope utilized a continuous band of film (approximately 50 feet), sprocket holes for transport, an electric lamp, and a rapidly revolving shutter that created the illusion of motion through the persistence of vision phenomenon.1\nWhile Edison's Kinetoscope offered individual viewing experiences, the \"official\" birth of cinema as a projected, communal experience is often attributed to Auguste and Louis Lumière in France. In 1895, they introduced the Cinématographe, a remarkably portable, hand-cranked device that could record, develop, and project motion pictures at 16 frames per second.2 This development underscored the international and iterative nature of cinema's invention, with numerous individuals and teams working on similar problems concurrently. These early experiments, drawing from photography, optics, and mechanics, laid the technological groundwork upon which the entire film industry would be built.1\nNickelodeons, Vaudeville Circuits, and Urban Audiences\nThe primary mode of early film exhibition evolved rapidly from individual \"peep show\" machines like the Kinetoscope to communal viewing in dedicated spaces. Emerging around 1905, nickelodeons were the first type of indoor venue specifically dedicated to showing projected motion pictures.6 These were typically converted storefronts, charging an admission fee of five cents—a \"nickel\"—hence their name. They flourished from roughly 1905 to 1915, profoundly altering the leisure-time habits of a significant segment of the American public.6\nBefore the rise of nickelodeons, films were often presented as one act among many in vaudeville theaters.6 Vaudeville, with its established circuits and diverse offerings of singers, comedians, and variety acts, provided an existing entertainment infrastructure and a ready audience for early cinema.7 Indeed, many of Edison's earliest films featured vaudeville performers enacting their routines before the camera.8 Nickelodeons, however, made films the central attraction. They typically seated fewer than 200 patrons, often on simple wooden chairs, and offered continuous performances of short films, which included brief narratives, \"scenics\" (travelogues), \"actualities\" (early documentaries), and comedies. Sometimes, these film programs were supplemented with illustrated songs or live vaudeville acts.6\nThe audience for these early cinemas was initially perceived by historians to be predominantly working-class, drawn by the low admission price.6 However, more recent scholarship suggests that middle-class patronage was also significant and grew throughout the nickelodeon era, particularly in densely populated urban areas where these theaters proliferated.6 The nickelodeon boom, especially between 1905 and 1907, was instrumental in cultivating a specialized spectator: \"the moviegoer,\" who began to integrate regular film attendance into their lives.6\nThe immense popularity of nickelodeons created a voracious demand for new film content. This spurred the growth of film production and led to crucial developments in distribution. Around 1903, film exchanges began to emerge, shifting the business model from exhibitors purchasing films outright to renting them.6 This rental system allowed theaters to change their programs more frequently, keeping audiences engaged and returning for new material.8 The nickelodeon thus played a pivotal role in democratizing entertainment and laying the commercial groundwork for a more structured film industry, marking a transition from film as a vaudeville novelty to cinema as a standalone entertainment business.6\nFrom Invention to Industry",

Thomas Edison, holding most of the major U.S. patents related to motion picture cameras in the 1890s, pursued an aggressive strategy of litigation against his competitors.3 These patent lawsuits by the Edison Manufacturing Company significantly impacted the nascent U.S. film industry, largely reducing domestic production to Edison's company and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company (Biograph), which utilized a different camera design.9 This legal pressure compelled many of Edison's rivals to import films from Europe.9\nIn an effort to consolidate control and stabilize the volatile market, Edison and a group of other dominant patent-holding companies, including Biograph (after initial exclusion and subsequent negotiation following Biograph's acquisition of the crucial Latham loop patent), Vitagraph, Essanay, Selig, Lubin, Kalem, and the French company Pathé Frères, formed the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC) in December 1908.9 Often referred to as the \"Edison Trust,\" the MPPC pooled 16 key patents covering films, cameras, projectors, and the Latham loop.9 The Trust aimed to create a monopoly over all aspects of filmmaking: production, distribution (primarily through its subsidiary, the General Film Company, established in 1910), and exhibition.9 A crucial element of their control was an exclusive agreement with Eastman Kodak, the leading supplier of raw film stock and an MPPC member, to sell film only to Trust-licensed producers.9\nThe MPPC implemented several business practices to standardize and control the industry. It replaced the outright sale of films with a rental system, which allowed for better quality control over prints. Uniform rental rates were established, intending to shift exhibitor focus from price to film quality, thereby encouraging an upgrade in production values.9 Initially, the Trust also limited film length, predominantly to one reel.9\nHowever, the MPPC's aggressive tactics and monopolistic aims spurred significant resistance from independent filmmakers and distributors who refused to pay license fees or operate under the Trust's restrictions.11 Many of these \"independents\" made a strategic move to Southern California, establishing Hollywood as a new production center. This relocation was driven by several factors: the distance from the MPPC's New York headquarters made patent enforcement more difficult; the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California was perceived as less inclined to enforce patent claims; the region offered a favorable climate for year-round outdoor filming and diverse landscapes; and, critically, its proximity to the Mexican border offered an escape route from MPPC lawsuits and equipment seizures, as the Trust's patents were not effective in Mexico.9 This migration was an unintended consequence of the MPPC's attempt to stifle competition on the East Coast; by trying to consolidate control, they inadvertently fueled the rise of the very entities that would eventually form the new nucleus of American filmmaking.\nThe MPPC's dominance began to wane due to a combination of factors. In 1911, Eastman Kodak modified its exclusive contract, allowing the sale of raw film stock to unlicensed independents.9 Patent litigation proved slow and ineffective against the rapidly growing number of independent companies.9 Furthermore, the Trust was slow to recognize and adapt to the growing popularity of feature-length films, a format largely pioneered and capitalized upon by the independents.9 The expiration of key patents in September 1913 significantly weakened the MPPC's control, as did the outbreak of World War I in 1914, which disrupted European markets that were important to MPPC members.9\nThe final blow came from the U.S. government. In United States v. Motion Picture Patents Co., a federal court ruled on October 1, 1915, that the MPPC's actions constituted an illegal restraint of trade under the Sherman Antitrust Act.9 This decision was upheld, and the Trust was effectively dissolved by 1917-1918.3 The MPPC's story illustrates an early, powerful attempt at vertical and horizontal integration in the American film industry, driven by a desire to control a chaotic but rapidly expanding market. Its rise and fall set a precedent for the ongoing tension between monopolistic control and independent innovation, a dynamic that would recur throughout the industry's history, from the studio system era to the age of digital streaming. The early establishment of specific business practices—exhibition models like Kinetoscope parlors and nickelodeons, distribution networks like film exchanges, and attempts at monopoly—occurred almost in tandem with technological invention, demonstrating that the \"industry\" aspect of cinema was co-created with its \"invention\" from the very beginning.4\nWeek 2: The Silent Era and Studio Formation (1910s–1920s)\nThe 1910s and 1920s marked a transformative period for the American film industry. With the power of the Motion Picture Patents Company waning, a new cohort of independent filmmakers and entrepreneurs, many of whom had strategically relocated to Southern California, began to consolidate their operations. This era witnessed the rise of the major studios that would come to define Hollywood, the standardization of production processes enabling mass output, and the evolution of these once-independent entities into a powerful new oligopoly.\nRise of Major Studios\nThe decline of",

With the power of the Motion Picture Patents Company waning, a new cohort of independent filmmakers and entrepreneurs, many of whom had strategically relocated to Southern California, began to consolidate their operations. This era witnessed the rise of the major studios that would come to define Hollywood, the standardization of production processes enabling mass output, and the evolution of these once-independent entities into a powerful new oligopoly.\nRise of Major Studios\nThe decline of the MPPC created a power vacuum that was quickly filled by ambitious independent filmmakers and producers.11 Many of these entities had established themselves in and around Los Angeles, drawn by a confluence of favorable conditions. The region offered a mild climate ideal for year-round filming, diverse geographical landscapes providing a variety of natural backdrops, access to relatively cheap labor, and, crucially, a significant distance from the MPPC's East Coast base and its aggressive patent enforcement tactics.11 The first studio in the Los Angeles area, Nestor Studios, opened its doors in 1911, and by 1915, over a dozen film production companies had made the westward migration from the East Coast.11\nDuring this period, the foundational entities of what would become Hollywood's major studios began to emerge and solidify their positions. Adolph Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, which later merged with the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company and then with Paramount Pictures distribution in 1917, pioneered the concept of a vertically integrated film company.15 Other future giants like the Fox Film Corporation (founded by William Fox) and the companies that would eventually merge to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924 (Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures, and Louis B. Mayer Productions) were also establishing their footholds.14 Warner Bros. was formally established by the four Warner brothers in 1924.15 These burgeoning studios, initially focused on production, rapidly expanded their operations to include film distribution and, significantly, the acquisition and construction of movie theaters, laying the groundwork for the vertically integrated studio system.14 This strategic shift from the East Coast patent-holding entities to West Coast production-centric companies was not merely geographical but represented a fundamental realignment of power and business strategy within the American film industry.\nStandardization of Production\nAs cinema transitioned from a novelty to a mature industry in the 1910s, the burgeoning studios recognized the need to standardize and rationalize their production activities to meet the escalating public demand for films.18 Drawing on principles of scientific management, they aimed to maximize efficiency, control costs, and produce films of increasing technical polish and narrative sophistication.18\nA key element of this standardization was the implementation of a strict division of labor within the studios.18 In the earliest days of filmmaking, individuals often performed multiple roles—producer, director, screenwriter, and cinematographer might all be the same person or a very small team. However, as studio operations expanded, specialized roles became defined. This led to the \"director-unit\" system, where a studio's creative talent was organized into distinct groups, often specializing in particular genres (e.g., Westerns, comedies), each headed by a single filmmaker responsible for a slate of pictures.18 Later, particularly with the rise of more complex and expensive feature films, this evolved into the \"producer-unit\" system. Central producers or supervisors, such as Thomas Ince at Triangle Studio, began to assume greater managerial control, especially in the pre-production phase, overseeing multiple director-led units and making key decisions regarding scripts, budgets, and schedules.18\nThe scenario script, and later the more detailed continuity script, became the cornerstone of this rationalized production process.18 Early films were often made from brief synopses or outlines. However, the demands of increased production quotas, budgetary constraints, and the narrative complexity of longer films necessitated more meticulous planning. The scenario script included a synopsis, a numbered breakdown of action by narrative event, and a \"scene plot\" that listed these events according to the locations where they were to be filmed. It also contained information for post-production personnel, such as planned intertitles and instructions for tinting and toning.18 Dedicated scenario departments were established within studios to develop stories, adapt existing works, and prepare these detailed shooting scripts.18\nThe continuity script took this planning to an even greater level of detail, becoming essentially a complete blueprint for and record of a film shoot. It featured elements of the scenario script but added shooting dates, highly detailed descriptions of actions, footage estimations for each shot, comprehensive budgetary data, and information on release prints and distribution.18 The development of the continuity script was also closely linked to evolving film style, particularly the increasing use of scene dissection—breaking scenes down into multiple shots. This required careful attention to matching character positions, movements, and eyelines across shots to maintain narrative clarity and a sense of continuous action, a practice best managed through detailed advance planning.18\nThis standardization of production methods was not merely an internal operational shift; it had profound implications for the films themselves. Narrative conventions and a shared cinematic language, including editing techniques and visual storytelling strategies, became remarkably standardized within the first two decades of cinema's existence.4 This industrial approach enabled studios to scale up production efficiently, but it also began to centralize creative control, laying the groundwork for the \"factory-like\" production model that would characterize the Hollywood studio system at its zenith.\nFrom Independents to Oligopoly: The Studio Takeover\nThe very independent filmmakers who had challenged the monopolistic practices of the Motion Picture Patents Company and migrated to Hollywood in search of creative and economic freedom ironically became the architects of a new, more sophisticated form of market control.11 Companies such as Adolph Zukor's Famous Players-Lasky Corporation (which became Paramount Pictures), William Fox's Fox Film Corporation, Carl Laemmle's Universal",

Production: Owning their own production facilities (studio lots with soundstages and backlots), camera equipment, and employing a vast array of creative and technical personnel under long-term contracts.\n2. Distribution: Establishing their own distribution networks to market and release their films nationally and internationally.\n3. Exhibition: Acquiring and operating chains of movie theaters, particularly first-run theaters in major urban centers, which guaranteed an outlet for their films and a significant share of box-office revenue.\nThis vertical integration provided immense market power.16 Studios could ensure preferential treatment for their own products, effectively limiting screen time for films from smaller, truly independent producers or foreign competitors. They implemented practices designed to maximize their profits and solidify their control. Block booking, for instance, forced theater owners to rent a studio's films in a large bundle, often including less desirable \"B-pictures\" alongside the A-list features that theaters actually wanted.11 Paramount Pictures was particularly known for this practice.20 Blind bidding often required exhibitors to commit to films before they had even seen them, based purely on the studio's marketing and star power.16\nAnother crucial element in the studios' consolidation of power was the development of the \"star system\".11 Studios signed promising actors and actresses to long-term, exclusive contracts, often for seven years. They then meticulously cultivated and controlled their stars' public personas through publicity departments, typecasting them in specific roles or genres that resonated with audiences.14 Stars became valuable studio assets, their drawing power used to ensure box-office success and differentiate studio product in an increasingly competitive marketplace. This system provided a bankable element that reduced the financial risk of individual film ventures.\nBy the late 1920s, this process of consolidation had resulted in the formation of an oligopoly. A handful of major studios—the companies that would soon be known as the \"Big Five\" (Paramount, MGM, Fox, Warner Bros., RKO) and the \"Little Three\" (Universal, Columbia, United Artists)—controlled the vast majority of film production and distribution in the United States.14 The journey from independent insurgency against one monopoly (the MPPC) to the establishment of a new, more powerful oligopoly centered in Hollywood demonstrates a recurring pattern of market dynamics in the American film industry. The freedom sought by early independents in California ironically provided the fertile ground for the growth of a new, dominant market structure that would define Hollywood for decades to come.\nWeek 3: The Introduction of Sound (Late 1920s–1930s)\nThe late 1920s witnessed a technological revolution that irrevocably transformed the American film industry and the cinematic experience itself: the introduction of synchronized sound. This transition from silent films to \"talkies\" was not instantaneous but involved a period of intense technological competition, significant financial investment and risk, and a fundamental restructuring of Hollywood's production and exhibition practices.\nTechnological Advancements in Sound Recording\nWhile the dream of synchronized sound had existed since cinema's inception, early attempts faced considerable hurdles. Inventors like Thomas Edison with his Kinetophone (1913) and France's Leon Gaumont with the Chronophone (1902) experimented with sound-on-disc systems, where a phonograph record was played in conjunction with the film projector.22 Simultaneously, pioneers like Eugene Lauste in 1910 explored sound-on-film technology, aiming to record sound directly onto the filmstrip.22 However, these early efforts were plagued by issues of unreliable synchronization, inadequate amplification for theatrical presentation, and poor sound quality.22\nA critical breakthrough came from Bell Telephone Laboratories. In 1913, Bell acquired the rights to Lee de Forest's Audion vacuum tube, a device that made electrical signal amplification practical, marking the dawn of the electronic era in sound recording.22 Engineers at Bell and its subsidiary, Western Electric, led by figures like Stanley Watkins, refined this technology. They developed high-quality condenser microphones and improved the process of cutting sound onto discs. This culminated in the Vitaphone system, a sound-on-disc process that used a special constant-speed motor to link the turntable and the projector, ensuring near-perfect synchronization.22 Warner Bros., then a relatively smaller studio, took a gamble on Vitaphone, famously showcasing it with Don Juan in 1926, which featured a synchronized orchestral score, and, more momentously, with The Jazz Singer in 1927, which included synchronized singing sequences and some spoken dialogue by Al Jolson.17 These releases ignited public excitement and signaled the impending demise of the silent era.\nConcurrently, sound-on-film technology was also maturing. Theodore W. Case and Earl I. Sponable, who had previously collaborated with Lee de Forest on his Phonofilm system (which used a variable density optical track), developed their own improved system.22 William Fox, head of Fox Film Corporation, acquired the rights to the Case-Sponable system and rebranded it as Movietone.22 Movietone recorded sound optically as a variable density track directly onto the same strip of film that carried the images, simplifying synchronization.25 Fox Movietone newsreels, featuring synchronized sound of current events",

The first professionally produced feature film with an optical soundtrack (primarily music and sound effects, with few synchronized words) was F.W. Murnau's Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927).25 The first all-talking feature film using sound-on-film technology, and notably the first to be shot largely outdoors, was In Old Arizona (1928).22 Another significant sound-on-film system, Photophone, which utilized a variable area track, was developed by RCA (Radio Corporation of America).22\nAlthough Vitaphone had the initial high-profile successes, sound-on-film systems like Movietone and Photophone ultimately proved more practical and reliable for widespread adoption. Sound-on-film eliminated the risk of discs breaking or wearing out and simplified distribution and exhibition, as sound and image were physically integrated. By 1928, Western Electric also offered its own sound-on-film technology, and its more favorable contract terms led most of the \"Big Five\" studios (MGM, Paramount, First National, Universal, and United Artists, in an early pact) to adopt it.23 Eventually, most major studios standardized on Western Electric's variable density recording process, while Warner Bros. (after its initial Vitaphone success), RKO (formed in part by RCA to exploit Photophone), and Republic Pictures utilized RCA's variable area system.22 This period of competing technologies rapidly gave way to an industry-wide embrace of optical sound-on-film.\nImpact on Production and Exhibition\nThe advent of synchronized sound precipitated a seismic shift in virtually every aspect of film production and exhibition, presenting both immense challenges and new creative opportunities.\nProduction:\nThe early days of sound recording were fraught with technical difficulties that heavily constrained filmmaking practices. The cameras themselves, with their noisy motors, had to be enclosed in large, soundproofed booths often called \"iceboxes\".24 This drastically limited camera mobility, leading to a period of relatively static, stage-bound cinematography, a stark contrast to the fluid camera work that had developed in the late silent era. To compensate, filmmakers sometimes resorted to using multiple cameras filming a scene simultaneously from different angles.24\nMicrophones also posed significant challenges. Early microphones were often bulky, relatively insensitive, and had to be strategically hidden on set, or actors had to remain within a limited range and speak directly towards them, leading to unnatural performances and staging.24 The noisy carbon arc lights, standard for studio interiors during the silent era, had to be replaced with quieter, though hotter and less efficient, incandescent lamps.26 This, in turn, necessitated the use of new, more light-sensitive (and more expensive) panchromatic film stock. While an added expense, panchromatic film offered superior tonal quality and greater latitude in lighting conditions.26\nA crucial technical standardization mandated by sound was the adoption of a strict projection and camera speed of 24 frames per second (fps).26 In the silent era, camera speeds could vary (often undercranked for better exposure or overcranked for slow-motion effects), and projectors were frequently run faster to shorten showtimes. Such variations were incompatible with intelligible sound reproduction.\nThe new emphasis on spoken dialogue had a profound impact on personnel. Screenwriters accustomed to silent film narrative had to learn the art of writing dialogue, and many Broadway playwrights were recruited to Hollywood.24 Acting styles underwent a dramatic transformation. The exaggerated pantomime often characteristic of silent film gave way to more naturalistic performances, and vocal quality became paramount. Many silent stars whose voices were deemed unsuitable for sound, or who struggled with dialogue delivery or foreign accents, saw their careers abruptly end. Conversely, stage actors with vocal training found new opportunities in Hollywood.24 To address some of these challenges, studios developed techniques such as pre-recording music and songs (playback), post-synchronization of dialogue (dubbing or looping), and even voice-doubling for actors with problematic voices.24\nExhibition:\nThe transition to sound was equally disruptive for theaters. Thousands of cinemas across the country had to be wired for sound, installing new projectors capable of sound reproduction, amplifiers, and loudspeaker systems—a significant capital investment, particularly challenging as the Great Depression began to take hold.22 Thousands of projectionists required retraining to operate and maintain the new, more complex equipment.22\nThe most immediate and culturally significant impact on exhibition was the displacement of live musical accompaniment. Silent films were rarely truly \"silent\"; they were almost invariably accompanied by live music, ranging from a solo pianist or organist in smaller venues to full orchestras in picture palaces.23 This live music provided emotional cues, created atmosphere, and was often tailored to local audience tastes. Some presentations also included live sound effects or even lecturers (like the benshi in Japan) who narrated the film.23 The introduction of recorded soundtracks standardized the auditory experience but eliminated the unique, live, and often improvisational element of silent film presentation.27 Live musicians found their services largely obsolete, as did vaudeville performers whose acts had often been part of the cinema program.23\nDespite the initial technical imperfections—early sound could be tinny, and voices sometimes sounded unnatural—the novelty of \"talking pictures\" proved immensely popular with audiences.24 The ability to hear actors speak and sing transformed the cinematic experience, making sound an indispensable element of filmmaking and a commercial necessity for studios and exhibitors alike.\nRestructuring Hollywood: Talkies, Risk",

Warner Bros., at the time a smaller, ambitious studio, was the primary catalyst.23 Seeking to expand its market share and differentiate its product, Warner Bros. invested heavily in Western Electric's Vitaphone sound-on-disc system.22 Their initial strategy viewed sound not primarily as a means for dialogue, but as a cost-cutting measure to provide synchronized orchestral accompaniment for their feature films, thereby eliminating the expense of live orchestras in their own theaters and offering a similar value proposition to other exhibitors.23 They also produced numerous Vitaphone short subjects featuring popular vaudeville and musical performers.22\nThe unprecedented success of The Jazz Singer in 1927, with its moments of synchronized dialogue and song, demonstrated the immense audience appetite for \"talkies\" and caught the larger, more established studios off guard.22 These major studios, initially hesitant due to the enormous costs of retooling production facilities and theater chains, and uncertain about the long-term viability of sound, were compelled to rapidly convert to sound technology to remain competitive.8 This involved massive reinvestment in new soundstages, recording equipment, cameras, projectors, and the retraining or replacement of personnel.24\nThe financial risks were substantial. The American film industry managed to reorient itself around the production of talking motion pictures with astonishing speed; by 1929, silent film production in the United States had effectively ceased on any significant scale.8 Despite the artistic challenges posed by early sound technology—the \"icebox\" cameras, immobile microphones, and the initial struggle to integrate sound naturally into narrative—filmgoing remained remarkably popular, even through the early years of the Great Depression.8 The novelty of hearing actors speak was a powerful draw.24\nThis transition consolidated the power of the major studios—the \"Big Five\" (Paramount, MGM, Fox, Warner Bros., RKO) and \"Little Three\" (Universal, Columbia, United Artists)—as they possessed the capital resources necessary to make the expensive conversion to sound.15 RKO Pictures, for instance, was formed in 1928 partly through the efforts of RCA to create a vertically integrated motion picture company that could exploit its Photophone sound-on-film system.15 Smaller studios that could not afford the transition often struggled or went out of business. The introduction of sound, therefore, was not just a technological shift but a major economic event that reshaped the industry's hierarchy, cementing the dominance of the major studios and setting the stage for the \"Golden Age of Hollywood.\" The risk taken by Warner Bros. illustrates a recurring dynamic in the film industry: innovation is often driven by less established players seeking a competitive edge, whose success then compels industry-wide adoption of the new technology or business model. Furthermore, the initial technological limitations of sound recording paradoxically spurred further innovation, as engineers and filmmakers worked to overcome these constraints, ultimately expanding the expressive capabilities of the medium. The industry's push for recorded, standardized soundtracks also reflected a desire for greater control over the product and the audience experience, moving away from the variability of live, localized accompaniments—a tension between industrial uniformity and artistic or local variation that would continue to surface in different forms.\nWeek 4: The Golden Age of Hollywood (1930s–1940s)\nThe period from the 1930s through the 1940s is widely recognized as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood.\" This era was characterized by the unparalleled dominance of the major film studios, a highly efficient, vertically integrated business model, the pervasive influence of the \"star system,\" the strategic use of new technologies like Technicolor, and the production of films within established genre formulas that captivated a mass audience. Despite the economic hardships of the Great Depression, Hollywood thrived, offering affordable escapism and shaping American popular culture to an unprecedented degree.\nStudio System Dominance\nDuring its Golden Age, Hollywood was effectively ruled by a handful of powerful film companies. The \"Big Five\" major studios—Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Paramount Pictures, Fox Film Corporation (which merged with Twentieth Century Pictures in 1935 to become 20th Century-Fox), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures—along with the \"Little Three\" smaller studios—Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists—controlled approximately 95% of the films exhibited in the United States between roughly 1930 and 1948.1 This concentration of power constituted a true oligopoly.\nThese studios operated with remarkable efficiency, often likened to industrial factories with an assembly-line approach to filmmaking.21 Every aspect of production, from script development to final editing, was tightly monitored and controlled by studio executives.21 MGM, for example, was the largest and often most financially successful studio during the 1930s, capable of having as many as 16 to 18 films in production simultaneously on its vast studio lots.1 The Great Depression, which devastated many other industries, paradoxically contributed to Hollywood's ascendancy. Movies provided an accessible and affordable form of escapism for a populace grappling with economic hardship, and weekly attendance remained high.17\nCentral to the studios' dominance was the \"star system\".1 Studios signed actors and actresses to long-term, often seven-year, exclusive",

Movies provided an accessible and affordable form of escapism for a populace grappling with economic hardship, and weekly attendance remained high.17\nCentral to the studios' dominance was the \"star system\".1 Studios signed actors and actresses to long-term, often seven-year, exclusive contracts. These contracts gave the studios immense control over their talent, dictating the roles they played, the films they appeared in, and even aspects of their public and private lives.14 Studio publicity departments meticulously crafted and maintained the public personas of their stars, transforming them into iconic figures whose names alone could guarantee audience turnout.17 Stars like Clark Gable, Greta Garbo, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Judy Garland, and Shirley Temple became household names and invaluable studio assets.20 This system, while often restrictive for the performers, was a cornerstone of the studios' financial success and cultural impact.\nVertical Integration\nThe economic backbone of the studio system's dominance during the Golden Age was vertical integration.1 The \"Big Five\" studios, in particular, controlled every stage of a film's journey from conception to consumption:\n* Production: They owned sprawling studio lots with soundstages, backlots, and vast technical resources. They employed thousands of writers, directors, producers, cinematographers, designers, technicians, and craftspeople, often under long-term contract. They also held their actors under exclusive contracts, as noted by the star system.\n* Distribution: Each major studio had its own extensive distribution network, responsible for marketing its films and supplying prints to theaters both domestically and internationally.\n* Exhibition: Crucially, the Big Five owned significant chains of movie theaters, particularly the lucrative first-run theaters in major metropolitan areas. This guaranteed an outlet for their films and allowed them to capture a substantial portion of box-office receipts.16\nThis control over the entire cinematic pipeline gave these studios absolute power over what films were made, how they were distributed, and where they were shown, effectively creating a closed market that maximized their profits and minimized risk.16 The \"Little Three\" studios (Universal, Columbia, and United Artists) generally lacked one or more of these integrated components; for instance, United Artists was primarily a distribution company for films made by independent producers, and Universal and Columbia owned fewer or no theaters.19\nPractices such as block booking and blind bidding were common tools used by the vertically integrated studios to solidify their market control.1 Block booking required independent theater owners to rent a studio's films as a package, often including several less desirable \"B-movies\" along with the A-list features they wanted. Paramount Pictures was particularly known for this strategy, sometimes bundling 52 to over 100 films in a single block.20 Blind bidding forced exhibitors to book films without having seen them, relying solely on the studio's reputation and marketing. Studios also controlled release patterns through systems of \"runs, zones, and clearances,\" which dictated how long a film would play in a particular theater and when it could move to subsequent-run houses, further ensuring that studio-owned or favored theaters received preferential treatment. These practices made it exceedingly difficult for truly independent producers and theater owners to compete effectively. This vertically integrated structure not only represented an economic monopoly but also a system for unprecedented cultural influence, as a small number of companies largely determined the narratives, values, and stars presented to a mass audience, with limited avenues for alternative voices to be heard on a wide scale.\nTechnicolor's Business Model and Market Impact\nThe Golden Age also saw color cinematography become a significant, albeit initially selective, feature of Hollywood filmmaking, largely through the efforts of the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation. Founded in 1915 by Herbert T. Kalmus, Daniel Comstock, and W. Burton Wescott, Technicolor became the dominant name in color film after perfecting its three-strip (or three-color) dye-transfer process in 1932.30 Earlier two-color Technicolor processes had seen some use in the 1920s and early 1930s, particularly in animated shorts like Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies, which proved popular with audiences and helped establish Technicolor's viability.30\nTechnicolor's business model was unique and contributed significantly to its market dominance. The company did not sell its technology outright; instead, it maintained tight control over its use. Studios wishing to film in Technicolor had to lease the company's proprietary three-strip cameras, which were bulky and required specialized camera crews often supplied by Technicolor.30 Furthermore, all Technicolor films had to be processed and printed at Technicolor's own laboratories to ensure quality control.30 Technicolor also employed \"color consultants,\" most famously Natalie Kalmus (Herbert Kalmus's ex-wife), who worked on set to advise productions on color design, costumes, and makeup to achieve the desired aesthetic according to Technicolor's guidelines.30 While intended to maintain high standards, this level of oversight also gave Technicolor considerable influence over the look of color films.\nThe company aggressively marketed \"Color by Technicolor\" not just as a process but as a brand, emphasizing its spectacle and box-office appeal.30 Studios were gradually convinced of its value, particularly for genres like musicals, historical epics, and animation, where vibrant color could enhance the fantasy and escapism offered to audiences.30 Films like The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Gone with the Wind (1939) showcased the stunning potential of three-strip Technicolor and became enduring classics.\nFor many years, Technicolor held a virtual monopoly on color filmmaking in Hollywood, controlling an estimated 90% of the color market.30 This dominance, however, led to complaints from studios about high costs, production delays due to limited camera availability, and the",

The decree required Technicolor to make many of its patents freely accessible or available for licensing at reasonable royalties and prohibited the company from tying the use of its cameras to the use of its processing labs or color consultants.30\nThe decline of Technicolor's dominance was further accelerated in the 1950s by the introduction and widespread adoption of Eastman Kodak's 'monopack' color negative film, known as Eastmancolor.30 This single-strip color film could be used in standard black-and-white cameras and processed by various laboratories, offering studios greater flexibility and lower costs than the cumbersome three-strip Technicolor process.30 While Technicolor adapted and continued to be a major player in film processing, its era of near-total control over color cinematography had ended. The story of Technicolor during the Golden Age is a compelling case study of how technological innovation, coupled with astute (and sometimes restrictive) business strategies, can lead to market dominance, and how such dominance can, in turn, be challenged by legal intervention and competing technologies.\nGenres as Brands: Marketing Entertainment Formulas\nDuring the Golden Age, Hollywood studios developed a sophisticated system of genre filmmaking that was integral to their production efficiency and marketing strategies.28 Each major studio, and even some of the smaller ones, became associated with particular types of films. For example, MGM was renowned for its lavish musicals and star-studded dramas; Warner Bros. gained fame for its gritty gangster films, \"social problem\" pictures, and fast-paced biographies; Universal Pictures became synonymous with horror films in the early 1930s; and Paramount was known for its sophisticated comedies and European-influenced productions.15\nThis specialization allowed studios to develop expertise in specific narrative formulas, streamline production processes by reusing sets, costumes, and technical crews, and cultivate talent (writers, directors, actors) suited to those genres.28 Genres, with their established conventions, character types, plot structures, and visual styles, became recognizable \"brands\".28 Audiences knew what to expect from a \"Warner Bros. gangster film\" or an \"MGM musical,\" and this predictability helped manage financial risk for the studios and guide consumer choice.28 Marketing campaigns heavily emphasized genre appeal and the presence of stars associated with those genres, alongside the studio's own brand identity (e.g., MGM's roaring lion logo).28 Promotional materials like posters, lobby cards, and trailers were designed to highlight these familiar and attractive elements.33\nThe content and narrative formulas of these genres were significantly shaped by the Motion Picture Production Code, commonly known as the Hays Code. Adopted in 1930 but strictly enforced from mid-1934 onwards under the leadership of Joseph Breen at the Production Code Administration (PCA), the Code was a form of industry self-censorship designed to preempt government regulation and address public concerns about morality in films.21 The Code established a detailed list of \"Don'ts\" and \"Be Carefuls,\" prohibiting depictions of explicit violence, profanity, \"sexual perversion\" (which effectively erased LGBTQ+ representation), and nudity, while heavily regulating portrayals of crime, passion, and religion.34 A key tenet was that crime must never pay, and criminals could not be presented sympathetically.34 While often criticized for stifling artistic expression and leading to sanitized or euphemistic storytelling 35, the Hays Code inadvertently reinforced genre branding. By mandating certain moral frameworks and narrative outcomes, it contributed to the formulaic nature of genres, making them even more predictable and thus easier to market as reliable entertainment products. Audiences seeking specific types of stories knew that, regardless of the studio, films within a certain genre would adhere to these underlying moral and narrative conventions.\nB-Movies and Double Features\nAn important, though less glamorous, economic component of the Golden Age studio system was the production and exhibition of \"B-movies\".28 These were low-budget films, typically produced quickly (often in one to three weeks) and cheaply, with production costs ranging from $10,000 to $200,000 in the 1930s.37 B-movies usually adhered to highly formulaic narratives within popular genres such as Westerns, crime thrillers, science fiction, and horror.37\nB-movies emerged primarily to fill the second slot in \"double feature\" programs, a common exhibition practice, particularly during the Great Depression.28 The double feature, offering two films for the price of one admission, was a strategy to provide audiences with greater value and attract them to theaters during economically challenging times.28 Theaters would pair a prestigious, high-budget \"A-picture\" with a more modest B-picture.\nWhile some smaller studios, often referred to as \"Poverty Row\" studios (such as Monogram Pictures and Republic Pictures), specialized in B-movie production 15, the major studios also produced their own B-films. These served several purposes: they kept studio contract players and technical crews continuously employed, utilized existing sets and resources efficiently, and provided a training ground for new directors, writers, and actors.37 Moreover, through practices like block booking",

This was partly due to the effects of the Paramount Decree, which, among other things, outlawed the block booking of short subjects with feature films and generally discouraged the coercive bundling practices that had supported B-movie distribution.20 As the double feature faded, the term \"B-movie\" evolved to more broadly describe any low-budget or exploitation film.37 Nevertheless, during the Golden Age, B-movies and the double feature model were crucial for maintaining a steady flow of content to theaters, maximizing studio profits, and shaping the overall cinema-going experience for a generation.\nThe following table provides an overview of the major Hollywood studios during this era, highlighting their key characteristics and contributions to the dominant studio system:\nThe Hollywood Studio System (c. 1930-1948)\n\n\nStudio\n\tKey Figures (Founders/Heads)\n\tNotable Genres/Stylistic Trademarks\n\tKey Stars Under Contract (Examples)\n\tExhibition Strength (Theater Ownership)\n\tThe Big Five\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\tLouis B.

This system, characterized by efficiency in production and tight market control, defined the Golden Age but also contained the seeds of its own transformation as external pressures and internal contradictions mounted.\nWeek 5: Post-War Challenges and Television's Rise (1940s–1950s)\nThe post-World War II era presented the American film industry with a series of profound challenges that collectively began to unravel the fabric of the Golden Age studio system. Antitrust litigation fundamentally altered the studios' business structures, while the rapid emergence of television as a powerful new entertainment medium directly competed for audiences. Simultaneously, demographic shifts, particularly the growth of suburbs and the rise of a distinct teenage culture, reshaped film consumption patterns and forced Hollywood to reconsider its target audience and content strategies.\nAntitrust Actions and the Paramount Decree\nFor years, the U.S. Department of Justice had scrutinized the monopolistic practices of the major Hollywood studios, particularly their vertical integration which combined production, distribution, and exhibition.16 These practices, including block booking and the control of first-run theaters, were seen as stifling competition and limiting consumer choice.29 The legal battle culminated in the landmark Supreme Court case United States v.

Paramount Pictures, et al..29\nIn its 1948 decision, the Supreme Court ruled decisively against the studios' prevailing business model.29 The core mandate of the \"Paramount Decree\" was the divestiture of studio-owned theater chains, effectively severing the exhibition arm from production and distribution and thus ending the era of complete vertical integration for the \"Big Five\" studios.29 Additionally, the Court outlawed practices such as block booking (forcing theaters to take an entire slate of films), blind bidding (requiring theaters to book films without previewing them), and other discriminatory arrangements that favored studio-owned theaters and limited access for independent exhibitors.29\nThe impact of the Paramount Decree was far-reaching. It marked the beginning of the decline of the traditional studio system.29 By forcing studios to sell their theaters—a process that took up to a decade for some to complete 41—the ruling leveled the playing field for independent filmmakers and theater owners, who gained greater access to screens that were previously closed off or offered unfavorable terms.11 Studios now had to compete for screen space for each film, leading them to become more discerning about the quality and marketability of their releases.29 While this created new opportunities for independents, the Decree, combined with other emerging challenges like television, contributed to a significant slump in the movie business.40 Hollywood's business strategy had to shift from a focus on controlling premier downtown theaters to exerting greater control over distribution channels and, increasingly, focusing on fewer, more expensive \"event\" productions.41 The long-term economic impact was complex; the decrees were eventually terminated in August 2020, with the Department of Justice citing substantial changes in the film industry (like the rise of streaming) and evolving applications of antitrust law.42 However, at the time of their implementation, they fundamentally altered the power dynamics and economic structure of Hollywood.\nEmergence of Television as a Competitor\nConcurrent with the legal upheavals of the Paramount Decree, a new technological and cultural force emerged: television. The adoption of television sets in American households grew exponentially in the 1950s, from approximately 1 million in 1949 to over 50 million by 1959.32 This rapid proliferation had an immediate and dramatic effect on cinema attendance. Weekly movie theater attendance in the U.S. plummeted from its peak of around 90 million in 1946 to roughly half that figure by the end of the 1950s.32\nTelevision offered a convenient and affordable alternative for entertainment directly in the home, fundamentally shifting audience viewing habits.32 Families began spending more evenings watching television programs rather than going out to the movies.32 Hollywood initially viewed television as a dire threat, fearing that free entertainment at home would decimate the demand for theatrical films and erode their profits.32\nTo combat this formidable competitor, Hollywood studios launched a multi-pronged counter-offensive:\n* Technological Differentiation: The primary strategy was to offer cinematic experiences that television, with its small, black-and-white screen and monophonic sound, could not replicate. This led to a wave of technological innovations designed to enhance the spectacle of the theatrical experience. Widescreen formats such as CinemaScope (introduced by 20th Century Fox in 1953 with The Robe), VistaVision (developed by Paramount), and the even more immersive Cinerama (requiring three synchronized projectors) became prominent.32 Color filmmaking also became more widespread; while Technicolor had been used for prestige pictures, Eastman Kodak's more flexible Eastmancolor process gained traction, and by the mid-1950s, over half of Hollywood films were being shot in color, up from around 20% in previous decades.31 Stereophonic sound systems were introduced to create a more immersive audio experience.32 Some studios even experimented with 3-D films as a novelty to draw audiences back.44\n* Content Differentiation: Studios began to produce more films with themes and content aimed at adult audiences, such as sophisticated dramas and comedies, seeking to provide experiences distinct from the generally family-friendly fare available on television.32 Epic productions with large casts, exotic locations, and grand spectacle also became a strategy to emphasize the \"bigger than life\" quality of cinema.32\n* Cooperation and New Markets: Over time, the adversarial relationship between Hollywood and television evolved. Studios recognized that television also represented a new market for their products. They began producing content specifically for television, such as \"movie of the week\" telefilms and television series, which opened up new revenue streams and employment opportunities for Hollywood talent.32 Furthermore, television's demand for programming provided an outlet for independent producers, who could create lower-budget films and sell them directly to television stations for broadcast, sometimes bypassing theatrical distribution altogether through syndication.32\nThe rise of television was thus a transformative challenge that compelled Hollywood to innovate technologically, diversify its content, and ultimately adapt its business models to coexist with and even profit from the new medium. This period marked a permanent change in how audiences consumed visual entertainment, with the theatrical experience increasingly positioned as a special event rather than a routine pastime.\nSuburbanization, Teens, and Demographic Targeting\nThe post-WWII American landscape was dramatically reshaped by suburbanization, a mass movement of population from urban centers to newly developed residential areas on their peripheries. This demographic shift had significant consequences for the film industry.41 As families, particularly white middle-class families, moved to the suburbs, they moved away from the downtown areas where many of the grand \"picture palaces\" and first-run theaters were located, contributing to the decline in urban cinema attendance.41 Increased",

    "content": "Demographic Targeting\nThe post-WWII American landscape was dramatically reshaped by suburbanization, a mass movement of population from urban centers to newly developed residential areas on their peripheries. This demographic shift had significant consequences for the film industry.41 As families, particularly white middle-class families, moved to the suburbs, they moved away from the downtown areas where many of the grand \"picture palaces\" and first-run theaters were located, contributing to the decline in urban cinema attendance.41 Increased car ownership, a hallmark of suburban life, also meant more leisure options and greater mobility, creating more competition for the moviegoing dollar.41\nOne cinematic innovation that thrived in this new suburban, car-centric culture was the drive-in theater.46 Drive-ins experienced a boom in popularity during the 1950s, offering an informal, affordable, and family-friendly moviegoing experience. Patrons could watch films from the privacy and comfort of their own cars, and drive-ins often featured playgrounds and other amenities that catered to families with young children.47 For teenagers, drive-ins also became popular social gathering spots and date destinations.48\nThe most profound impact of these converging social and economic changes was a fundamental shift in Hollywood's target audience. With adult attendance declining due to television and changing lifestyles, the film industry discovered a new, avid demographic: teenagers and young adults. By 1956, it was estimated that this group purchased as much as 87% of all movie tickets sold in the U.S..45 This realization led Hollywood to begin seriously targeting the youth market for the first time, a significant departure from its previous focus on a broader, more mainstream adult audience.41\nThis new focus resulted in the \"juvenilization\" of American movies, with the emergence of \"teenpics\"—films specifically made for and marketed to teenagers, sometimes to the exclusion of older viewers.49 These films often explored themes relevant to adolescent life and anxieties, and encompassed various genres, including rock 'n' roll musicals, stories about juvenile delinquency (j.d. films), horror and science fiction films designed to thrill young audiences, and more wholesome \"clean teen\" comedies and romances.50 Landmark films like Blackboard Jungle (1955), which featured rock and roll music, and Rebel Without a Cause (1955), which made James Dean an icon of teenage angst, were indicative of this trend.49 The anxieties of suburban life itself also found expression in a new subgenre known as \"Suburban Gothic,\" which often explored the darker undercurrents beneath the placid surface of middle-class conformity.51\nThe convergence of the Paramount Decree, the rise of television, and the suburbanization movement created an existential crisis for the established studio system. Each factor individually would have posed a significant challenge; together, they forced a radical restructuring of Hollywood's technological approaches, content strategies, and business models. The industry's pivot towards the youth market was not merely a passing trend but a critical survival strategy in the face of a shrinking adult audience, a demographic shift that would have lasting repercussions on the types of films produced and marketed by Hollywood for decades to come. Furthermore, Hollywood's technological response to television—emphasizing widescreen spectacle, vibrant color, and immersive sound—can be seen as an early iteration of a recurring strategy: using technological innovation to differentiate the theatrical experience from burgeoning home entertainment options, a pattern that would repeat with the advent of home video and, later, digital streaming.\nWeek 6: Independent Cinema and New Hollywood (1960s–1970s)\nThe 1960s and 1970s marked a period of profound upheaval and creative resurgence in the American film industry. The traditional studio system, already weakened by legal and economic pressures in the preceding decade, continued its decline, creating an opening for new voices and filmmaking styles. This era saw the emergence of influential \"auteur\" directors, heavily inspired by European New Wave cinema, who challenged classical Hollywood conventions and connected with a younger, more socially conscious audience. This \"New Hollywood\" or \"Hollywood Renaissance\" temporarily shifted creative control towards directors and produced some of American cinema's most iconic and artistically ambitious works.\nDecline of the Studio System\nThe foundations of the classical Hollywood studio system, which had dominated American filmmaking since the 1920s, significantly eroded throughout the 1960s.11 The long-term effects of the 1948 Paramount Decree, which forced studios to divest their theater chains, continued to be felt, stripping them of guaranteed exhibition outlets and a key source of revenue.11 Competition from television remained intense, siphoning off audiences and advertising dollars.55 Furthermore, the rise of popular foreign films and an influx of international productions provided American audiences with alternatives to traditional Hollywood fare.55\nInternally, studios faced rising production costs and a growing disconnect with the tastes of contemporary audiences, particularly the burgeoning youth market and counterculture movements of the 1960s.54 The old formulas and aging studio executives often failed to resonate with a generation grappling with issues like the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, and changing social mores.55 Catastrophic financial failures of expensive, old-fashioned epic films, such as Cleopatra (1963) and Doctor Dolittle (1967), underscored this crisis and made studios more desperate, and paradoxically, sometimes more willing to take risks on new talent and unconventional projects.55\nAs a result, studios began to produce fewer films, often focusing their resources on a smaller number of potentially larger productions. They also shed many of their long-term contract personnel, from stars to technicians.41 The \"package-unit system\" of production became more prevalent. Instead of developing projects entirely in-house with contract talent, studios increasingly financed and distributed films that were brought to them as packages by independent producers, often with key creative elements—such as a star, director, or screenwriter—already attached.11 This shift",

The \"auteur theory\" (from the French word for \"author\") had its origins in French film criticism of the 1950s, particularly in the writings of critics associated with the journal Cahiers du Cinéma, such as François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and André Bazin.59 This theory championed the director as the primary artistic visionary of a film, whose personal style, thematic preoccupations, and worldview could be discerned across their body of work, much like that of a novelist or painter.59 American film critic Andrew Sarris was instrumental in popularizing auteur theory in the United States in the early 1960s with his influential writings and rankings of directors.59\nAs the traditional studio system's grip on production weakened, a new generation of filmmakers, many of whom were film school educated (the \"film school brats\"), gained unprecedented creative control over their projects.56 Directors like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Robert Altman, Arthur Penn, Sidney Lumet, and Hal Ashby, among others, emerged as prominent figures of this \"New Hollywood\" era, which lasted roughly from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.58 These directors often wrote or co-wrote their screenplays and exerted significant influence over casting, cinematography, and editing, imprinting their personal stamp on their films.61\nThe films produced by these auteurs were frequently characterized by their thematic complexity, formal innovation, and moral ambiguity. They often tackled controversial social and political issues, featured anti-heroes and flawed protagonists, and deviated from classical Hollywood narrative conventions, employing techniques such as non-linear storytelling, ambiguous endings, and a more realistic or gritty visual style.57 This shift towards director-driven, personal filmmaking marked a significant departure from the producer-dominated, formulaic output of the classical studio era and led to a period of remarkable artistic vitality in American cinema.\nEuropean New Wave Influence and International Competition\nThe artistic and thematic direction of New Hollywood was profoundly shaped by the influx of European cinema that had gained traction in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s.55 Movements like the French New Wave (spearheaded by former Cahiers du Cinéma critics like Godard and Truffaut), Italian Neorealism (with directors such as Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni pushing its boundaries), and the works of individual auteurs like Sweden's Ingmar Bergman and Japan's Akira Kurosawa captivated American filmmakers and a segment of the audience hungry for more challenging and sophisticated fare.56\nThese European films often featured unconventional narrative structures, a focus on realism (sometimes shot on location with non-professional actors or with handheld cameras), a more subjective or personal point of view, and a willingness to explore complex psychological and social themes.57 New Hollywood directors consciously adopted and adapted many of these stylistic and thematic elements. They re-worked traditional Hollywood genres—such as the crime film, the Western, and the war film—infusing them with a more critical perspective on American society, a greater psychological depth, and a more contemporary sensibility.57 Landmark films of the early New Hollywood period, such as Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider (1969), clearly demonstrated these European influences in their visual style, narrative approach, and anti-establishment tone.56\nThe growing popularity of foreign and art house films in the U.S. not only provided artistic inspiration but also represented a new form of international competition for Hollywood.55 These films filled a void left by the struggling domestic studios and catered to a more discerning, often younger and college-educated, audience.55 The commercial success of some of these foreign films, including those with more explicit content like Antonioni's Blow-Up (1966), also played a role in challenging the Production Code, which was seen as increasingly outdated. This pressure contributed to the Code's abandonment and replacement by the MPAA film rating system in 1968, which allowed filmmakers greater freedom in depicting mature themes, violence, and sexuality.55 The success of European films in the U.S. market served as a crucial signal to Hollywood studios that there was an audience for different kinds of storytelling, encouraging them to invest in American directors who could deliver similarly innovative and relevant work.\nMarketing the Auteur: Youth Culture and Counter-Hollywood\nThe films of the New Hollywood era frequently resonated deeply with the youth culture and countercultural movements that were transforming American society in the late 1960s and 1970s.55 These films often addressed the anxieties, aspirations, and disillusionment of a generation questioning traditional values and authority, tackling themes of war, corruption, racism, alienation, and individual freedom.57\nMarketing strategies during this period began to shift accordingly. While star power remained important, the directors themselves—as \"auteurs,\" \"visionaries,\" or even \"mavericks\"—often became part of the film's appeal and were marketed as such.61 The director's personal brand and artistic integrity were highlighted, appealing to an audience that valued authenticity and a departure",

Films often featured anti-heroes or morally complex protagonists, reflecting a more cynical and realistic worldview that connected with younger viewers.57\nThe establishment of the MPAA rating system in 1968 was a pivotal development, granting filmmakers significantly more freedom to address adult themes, depict violence and sexuality more frankly, and use stronger language.56 This allowed New Hollywood films to cater to a maturing audience and to differentiate themselves starkly from the more sanitized content available on television. Marketing campaigns often emphasized the novelty, realism, edginess, and \"authenticity\" of these films, positioning them as a \"counter-Hollywood\" alternative to the perceived artificiality and conservatism of older studio productions.57 This focus on the director's vision and the film's relevance to contemporary social and cultural currents, particularly those engaging youth culture, became a defining characteristic of how New Hollywood films were presented and received.\nThe decline of the old studio system, driven by a confluence of legal, economic, and societal shifts, created the very conditions of financial desperation and the search for new audiences that allowed for the rise of auteur directors and the artistic experimentation of New Hollywood. These directors, inspired by European cinema and empowered by a changing industry landscape, initially revitalized American filmmaking with innovative and often successful works. However, the emphasis on directorial control, while leading to artistic breakthroughs, sometimes resulted in challenging productions and budget overruns. This, in turn, would eventually make studios wary, paving the way for a return to more producer-driven, high-concept films as the industry sought more predictable financial returns, a transition that would define the subsequent era.\nWeek 7: Blockbusters and Franchise Films (1970s–1980s)\nThe mid-1970s marked a significant turning point in the American film industry, signaling a shift away from the auteur-driven, often more personal and challenging films of the New Hollywood era towards the dominance of the \"blockbuster.\" Characterized by high-concept premises, massive marketing campaigns, groundbreaking special effects, and the logic of franchise building, this new model aimed for broad global appeal and substantial financial returns, fundamentally reshaping Hollywood's business strategies and creative priorities.\nHigh-Concept Films\nA defining characteristic of the blockbuster era was the rise of the \"high-concept\" film.65 These were movies built around a premise that could be easily summarized in a concise, attention-grabbing sentence or two—often in 25 words or less—making them readily marketable and understandable to a mass audience.65 The term is often associated with producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, whose films in the 1980s, such as Flashdance (1983), Beverly Hills Cop (1984, with its clear \"fish-out-of-water\" concept), and Top Gun (1986), epitomized this approach.65\nHowever, the roots of high-concept filmmaking can be traced to the latter half of the 1970s with the phenomenal success of films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975 – a giant shark terrorizes a beach town), George Lucas's Star Wars (1977 – a farm boy joins a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away), and Ridley Scott's Alien (1979 – often pitched as \"Jaws in space\").11 These films demonstrated the immense commercial potential of a strong, easily communicable central idea, often blended with familiar genre elements, star power (or emerging stars), and a significant emphasis on visual spectacle.65 High-concept films were designed for broad appeal, lending themselves well to extensive marketing, merchandising, and, crucially, the development of sequels and franchises. This shift represented a move towards films that prioritized premise and spectacle, sometimes at the expense of the narrative complexity or deep character development that had characterized many New Hollywood films. From a business perspective, high-concept was a strategy for simplifying the pitching process to studios and for mitigating risk by investing in ideas that were perceived as having clear, built-in audience appeal.\nMarketing and Merchandising Strategies\nThe blockbuster era witnessed a revolution in how films were marketed and sold to the public, with marketing budgets often rivaling production costs.65 The success of Jaws and Star Wars served as a blueprint for these new strategies.63 Jaws, for instance, pioneered the use of \"saturation booking\" or wide releases, opening on hundreds of screens simultaneously across the country, accompanied by a heavy national television advertising campaign to create an immediate sense of an \"event\".33 This was a departure from the traditional platform release strategy, where a film would open in a few major cities and then gradually expand based on its performance.\nThe goal of blockbuster marketing was to generate massive pre-release awareness and anticipation, turning a film's opening weekend into a significant cultural moment and maximizing initial box-office returns.65 This involved extensive use of trailers 66, posters, and aggressive advertising across various media, especially television.\nMerchandising also became an enormously important ancillary revenue stream, particularly following the unprecedented success of Star Wars merchandise.67 George Lucas had astutely retained the merchandising rights for Star Wars, and the vast sales of toys, apparel, books, and other tie-in products demonstrated that a film's profitability could extend far beyond the box office.63 This led studios to increasingly view films not just as standalone products but as potential intellectual properties (IP) that could be exploited across multiple platforms and product lines.

Product placement within films also became a more organized and lucrative practice during this period. The prominent featuring of Reese's Pieces in Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), which led to a significant sales boost for the candy, is a classic example of this synergy.68 These evolving marketing and merchandising strategies transformed Hollywood into an industry increasingly focused on creating and exploiting branded entertainment.\nAdvancements in Special Effects\nThe visual spectacle of the blockbuster was heavily reliant on continuous advancements in special effects technology, which became a key selling point for these \"event\" films.69 The 1970s and 1980s saw a revolution in both practical effects (achieved physically on set) and optical/early digital visual effects (created in post-production).\nGeorge Lucas's Star Wars (1977) was a watershed moment. His newly formed company, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), co-founded by special effects supervisor John Dykstra, pioneered numerous techniques.69 Among the most significant was the Dykstraflex, a computer-controlled motion-control camera system.69 This system allowed for the precise, repeatable movement of the camera, enabling the complex compositing of multiple elements—such as separately filmed miniature spaceships, model surfaces like the Death Star, and starfield backgrounds—into dynamic and believable action sequences.69 This work drew upon earlier research conducted at the University of California, Berkeley's Environmental Simulation Laboratory, which explored creating realistic simulations using miniatures and computer-controlled cameras.69\nFilms like Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Scott's Alien (1979), Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and Scott's Blade Runner (1982) continued to push the boundaries, showcasing sophisticated model work, advanced matte paintings, animatronics (lifelike robotic creatures), and innovative optical printing techniques.70 While full-scale computer-generated imagery (CGI) for character animation was still in its early stages, its use for specific, groundbreaking effects began to appear. Examples include the \"Genesis sequence\" in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), which depicted the terraforming of a planet, and the first fully CGI character, the stained-glass knight, in Barry Levinson's Young Sherlock Holmes (1985).71 These advancements in special effects were not merely technical achievements; they became integral to the marketing of blockbusters, promising audiences visual experiences they could not get anywhere else, particularly on television. This technological \"arms race\" continually raised audience expectations for on-screen spectacle.\nFranchise Logic: Risk Mitigation and Global Appeal\nThe extraordinary financial success of films like Jaws and particularly Star Wars and their sequels (The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi) gave birth to the modern film franchise as a dominant business model in Hollywood.63 Building franchises around successful intellectual properties (IP)—whether original hits or adaptations of pre-sold properties like comic books or novels—became a core strategy for studios to mitigate the enormous financial risks associated with blockbuster filmmaking.67 Sequels, prequels, and spin-offs offered a degree of predictability, with built-in audience recognition, established characters, and narrative worlds that reduced the uncertainty inherent in launching entirely new properties.67\nFranchise films were typically designed for broad global appeal. They often emphasized action, spectacle, and universal themes (good vs. evil, heroism) that could more easily transcend cultural and linguistic barriers, thereby maximizing international box-office revenues, which were becoming increasingly important to Hollywood's bottom line.67 The development and exploitation of IP across multiple media—including films, television shows, video games, merchandise, and theme park attractions—became a central focus for studios, aiming to create long-term, diversified revenue streams from a single successful property.67\nThis shift towards franchise logic marked a significant departure from the auteur-driven, often more personal and idiosyncratic films that had characterized much of the New Hollywood era.56 While some New Hollywood directors like Spielberg and Lucas became architects of this new blockbuster/franchise model, the overall trend saw a return to more producer-driven, market-focused decision-making, with studios reasserting greater creative and financial control over their major releases.63 The transition was complex: it evolved from the event potential demonstrated by some earlier New Hollywood successes, reacted against the financial unpredictability of certain auteur projects (like Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate 57), and co-opted the youth-oriented focus into a more formulaic, high-concept, and easily replicable model. While the Paramount Decree had dismantled the old vertical integration based on theater ownership, the rise of franchise logic can be seen as creating a new form of vertical integration centered on the control and multi-platform exploitation of valuable intellectual property.\nWeek 8: The Home Video Revolution (1980s–1990s)\nThe 1980s and 1990s witnessed another transformative shift in the American film industry with the widespread adoption of home video technology, primarily the videocassette recorder (VCR). This \"home video revolution\" fundamentally altered how audiences consumed films, created substantial new revenue streams for the industry, and necessitated new business strategies regarding film distribution and the lifecycle of a motion picture.\nVHS and the Rental Market\nThe emergence of the home video market was driven by the increasing accessibility of VCRs.

This \"home video revolution\" fundamentally altered how audiences consumed films, created substantial new revenue streams for the industry, and necessitated new business strategies regarding film distribution and the lifecycle of a motion picture.\nVHS and the Rental Market\nThe emergence of the home video market was driven by the increasing accessibility of VCRs. Initially introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s, VCRs were expensive luxury items.73 However, as prices gradually decreased, ownership became more widespread. A key development in this period was the \"format war\" between JVC's VHS (Video Home System) and Sony's Betamax. Despite Betamax's initial lead and perceived technical superiority by some, VHS ultimately triumphed to become the dominant global standard for consumer videotape, largely due to longer recording times and more aggressive licensing by JVC.73\nGiven the high initial cost of both VCRs and pre-recorded videocassettes (which could cost $100 or more), a vibrant video rental market quickly developed.73 Small, independent \"mom-and-pop\" video stores proliferated across communities, allowing consumers to rent both VCR players and tapes at affordable prices.73 The first company to commercially release movies on VHS was Andre Blay's Video Club of America, which in 1977 secured rights from 20th Century-Fox to distribute fifty of its library titles on videocassette.73 By the late 1980s, the rental landscape included not only these independent stores but also large national chains, most notably Blockbuster Video, which became a cultural institution.73\nThe film industry's initial reaction to home video technology was one of fear and hostility. Studios were concerned that the ability to record television broadcasts and, eventually, to rent or buy pre-recorded movies would lead to widespread copyright infringement and cannibalize theatrical box office revenue. Jack Valenti, then head of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), famously testified before Congress comparing the VCR to \"the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone,\" expressing deep concerns about its potential impact.74\nA pivotal moment in the legal landscape of home video was the Supreme Court's 1984 decision in Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., commonly known as the \"Betamax case\".75 Universal and Disney had sued Sony, arguing that manufacturing and selling Betamax VCRs constituted contributory copyright infringement because consumers used them to record copyrighted television programs. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled in favor of Sony. It held that the noncommercial home recording of television programs for the purpose of \"time-shifting\" (i.e., watching a program at a later, more convenient time) constituted fair use and did not infringe copyright.75 Crucially, the Court also ruled that manufacturers of devices capable of \"substantial non-infringing uses\" could not be held liable for contributory infringement simply because the technology could be used for infringing purposes.75 This decision provided a crucial legal safe harbor for VCR technology and was a significant boon to the burgeoning home video market, allowing it to flourish without the threat of crippling legal challenges.\nImpact on Film Distribution and Revenue\nContrary to the industry's initial fears, home video quickly evolved into an enormously lucrative new revenue stream for Hollywood.73 By the mid-to-late 1980s, revenues from home video rentals and sales began to rival, and in many cases surpass, theatrical box office earnings for individual films.73 This new financial reality forced Hollywood to fundamentally rethink its distribution strategies and film budgeting processes, as potential income from the home video market became a significant factor in greenlighting and financing productions.73\nStudios adapted their approach to the video market. Initially, some studios licensed their films for video release, but they soon moved towards directly selling pre-recorded videocassettes to rental stores and, increasingly, to consumers for their personal libraries (the \"sell-through\" market).73 The sell-through market was particularly boosted by family films and animated features; for example, Walt Disney Productions' 1987 video release of Lady and the Tramp at a consumer-friendly price point of $29.95 sold millions of copies, demonstrating the potential of this direct-to-consumer channel.73\nThe home video market also had a democratizing effect on the types of films that could achieve financial success. It provided a new avenue for independent films and smaller productions that might have had limited theatrical releases or struggled to find a wide audience in cinemas.74 Companies like Miramax and New Line Cinema skillfully utilized the video market to build their businesses and bring alternative voices to a larger public.74 Films that underperformed at the box office could find a \"second life\" on video, recouping costs and even turning a profit through rentals and sales.75 Distribution practices also had to accommodate the technical realities of home viewing; widescreen theatrical films, for example, were often subjected to \"pan and scan\" formatting to fit the standard 4:3 aspect ratio of television screens prevalent at the time, a practice often criticized by filmmakers and cinephiles.73\nChanges in Consumer Behavior\nThe home video revolution brought about profound changes in how audiences interacted with films. The VCR empowered consumers with unprecedented control over their viewing experience.73 For the first time on a mass scale, viewers could choose precisely what they wanted to watch, when they wanted to watch it, and how they wanted to watch it—with the ability to pause, rewind, fast-forward, and re-watch films at their leisure.73\nThis newfound control led to significant shifts in movie-viewing habits. The ritual of going to the cinema as the primary way to see a film was supplemented, and for some, replaced, by the convenience of home viewing.

The ritual of going to the cinema as the primary way to see a film was supplemented, and for some, replaced, by the convenience of home viewing. The \"Saturday night trip to the video store\" became a widespread cultural phenomenon, as families and individuals browsed shelves packed with a vast array of titles.75 Home video also made a much larger library of films, including older classics, foreign films, and niche genres, accessible to a broader audience than was typically available in local movie theaters. This potentially broadened cinematic tastes and fostered a new generation of film enthusiasts. The act of watching a movie transformed from being primarily a public, event-based experience to a more common, private, and personalized form of home entertainment.73 This shift in the power dynamic, giving consumers more agency over their media consumption, was a precursor to the even greater control and choice that would be offered by digital streaming services in subsequent decades.\nWindowing Strategies and Second Lives for Film\nThe emergence of the lucrative home video market necessitated a more sophisticated approach to film release \"windowing\".79 Windowing is the business strategy of releasing a film sequentially across different platforms and markets over time, with each \"window\" typically priced differently, to maximize overall revenue.79 While the concept existed before home video (e.g., theatrical release followed by television broadcast), the VCR introduced a critical new window.\nThe typical release strategy in the 1980s and 1990s would see a film first released in theaters (the most expensive viewing option per person). After its theatrical run, it would move to the home video rental market, followed by the home video sell-through market (often at a lower price point). Subsequent windows could include pay-per-view, premium cable channels (like HBO), and finally, broadcast television.79 This tiered approach allowed studios to extract maximum value from a film by targeting different consumer segments at different price sensitivities over an extended period.\nHome video was instrumental in giving films a \"second life\".75 Films that may have had a modest or even disappointing theatrical performance could find new audiences and generate significant revenue in the rental and sell-through markets.75 For successful blockbusters, home video provided an additional, substantial stream of profit long after they had left cinemas. This extended commercial viability significantly altered the financial lifecycle of films and further solidified the economic importance of the home entertainment sector. The irony of the film industry's initial vehement opposition to the VCR, which ultimately became a financial savior and a transformative force for content accessibility, serves as a notable historical parallel to later industry anxieties surrounding emerging digital distribution technologies.\nWeek 9: Digital Transformation (1990s–2000s)\nThe 1990s and 2000s ushered in a period of profound digital transformation for the American film industry, fundamentally altering the tools and processes of filmmaking from image capture to post-production and beyond. The introduction of viable digital cameras, the rapid evolution of computer-generated imagery (CGI), and the shift to non-linear digital editing systems collectively redefined the medium's aesthetic possibilities, production workflows, and economic landscape. This era also saw the beginnings of digital convergence and globalization, trends that would bring new opportunities alongside complex challenges and forms of \"global discontent.\"\nIntroduction of Digital Filmmaking\nThe technological underpinnings of digital filmmaking trace back to the invention of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) image sensors, such as the charge-coupled device (CCD) in 1969 and later the CMOS active-pixel sensor.81 While early experiments with \"electronic cinematography\" using analog high-definition video systems (like Sony's HDVS) occurred in the late 1980s, producing films such as Julia and Julia (1987), it was in the 1990s that digital video began to make serious inroads into professional filmmaking.82\nSeveral productions in the mid-to-late 1990s served as important milestones. Rainbow (1996) was shot entirely on Sony's early solid-state electronic cinematography cameras and featured extensive digital post-production, with the final digital high-definition image being transferred to 35mm film for theatrical release.82 Windhorse, also shot in 1996 using Sony's Digital Betacam and prosumer DCR-VX1000 cameras, underwent an all-digital post-production workflow before being transferred to film.82 The introduction of HDCAM recorders and digital cameras capable of 1920x1080 pixel resolution in 1997 further spurred the adoption of \"digital cinematography\".82 Some consider The Last Broadcast (1998) to be the first feature-length film shot and edited entirely on consumer-level digital equipment.82\nA major catalyst for the industry's shift was filmmaker George Lucas, who championed digital technology. He included footage shot with high-definition digital cameras in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) and subsequently announced his intention to film the sequels entirely in digital.82 Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (shot 2000-2001, released 2002) was indeed captured entirely with Sony HDW-F900 digital cameras.82 Other pioneering digitally shot features around this time included Pitof's Vidocq (2001), recognized by Guinness World Records as the first full-length feature filmed in digital high resolution, and Alexander Sokurov's Russian Ark (2002), notable for being the first feature film recorded directly to a hard disk drive (HDD) instead of tape, in a single, continuous shot.82\nThe early 2000s saw continued advancements and wider acceptance.

By 2009, Slumdog Millionaire became the first predominantly digitally shot film to win the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and James Cameron's Avatar (2009), also shot digitally (and heavily reliant on digital 3D and CGI), became the highest-grossing film of all time, with much of its revenue coming from digital projection.82 The development of more affordable yet high-quality digital cinematography cameras, such as the RED One (introduced in 2007) and professional-grade DSLRs like the Canon 5D Mark II (which offered 1080p video), significantly democratized access to high-quality image capture, allowing independent filmmakers to achieve results comparable to 35mm film at a fraction of the cost.13 This shift from celluloid film to digital data streams was a monumental transformation, impacting every stage of the filmmaking process, from pre-production planning to on-set workflows, post-production, and theatrical exhibition.\nComputer-Generated Imagery (CGI)\nAlongside digital capture, computer-generated imagery (CGI) underwent a dramatic evolution, becoming an indispensable tool for visual storytelling. While early uses of CGI in films date back to the 1970s and 1980s—with examples like the vector graphics in Star Wars (1977), the digital environments of Tron (1982), and the first fully CGI character (a stained-glass knight) in Young Sherlock Holmes (1985) 71—it was the 1990s that saw CGI mature into a sophisticated and versatile technology.\nSeveral landmark films of the early 1990s showcased these advancements and their narrative potential. The \"pseudopod\" water creature in James Cameron's The Abyss (1989) was a breakthrough in realistic CGI. The liquid metal T-1000 character in Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) demonstrated CGI's ability to create fluid, morphing forms. Perhaps most famously, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993) brought dinosaurs to life with a stunning combination of animatronics and CGI, convincing audiences of the reality of these prehistoric creatures and setting a new benchmark for visual effects.71\nA pivotal moment for animation and the broader film industry was the release of Pixar's Toy Story in 1995, the first entirely computer-animated feature film.71 This not only revolutionized the animation industry but also demonstrated the potential of CGI for creating entire worlds and characters from scratch. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, CGI became increasingly integral to blockbuster filmmaking, used to create fantastical environments, elaborate action sequences, digital stunt doubles, and subtle visual enhancements that would be impossible, too dangerous, or prohibitively expensive to achieve with practical effects alone.72 The increasing sophistication of CGI software and the exponential growth in computing power made professional-grade visual effects more accessible, not only to major studios but also to a wider range of filmmakers, significantly expanding the visual palette of cinema.71\nEvolution of Editing and Post-Production\nThe digital transformation profoundly reshaped the post-production landscape, most notably through the evolution of editing. Traditional film editing was a laborious, physical process of cutting and splicing celluloid film strips on machines like the Moviola or Steenbeck.83 This linear process meant that changes were time-consuming and destructive to the original material.\nThe late 1980s and 1990s saw the advent and widespread adoption of digital non-linear editing systems (NLEs).83 Avid Media Composer, introduced in 1989, was a pioneering system that quickly gained traction in professional film and television post-production. It was followed by other influential NLEs such as Apple's Final Cut Pro (released in 1999) and Adobe Premiere Pro.83 These systems allowed editors to work with digitized footage on a computer, providing instant access to any part of the material and the ability to make cuts, rearrange sequences, and experiment with different versions non-destructively.83 This fluid, non-linear workflow dramatically increased editing speed, precision, and creative flexibility, allowing for more complex and nuanced edits than were practical with traditional methods.83\nDigital post-production extended beyond editing to encompass a wide range of processes, including color correction and grading, sound design and mixing, visual effects integration, and the creation of final master prints, all managed within a digital environment. The increasing affordability and power of personal computers, coupled with sophisticated NLE software, also had a democratizing effect on post-production.13 Independent filmmakers and smaller production companies could now achieve professional-quality editing and finishing at a significantly lower cost than was previously possible, when such work required expensive, specialized facilities.13 This accessibility was a critical component of the overall digital revolution in filmmaking.\nDigital Convergence and Global Discontent\nThe 1990s and 2000s were also characterized by the accelerating trends of digital convergence and globalization, which brought both new opportunities and significant challenges to the film industry. Digital convergence refers to the blurring of boundaries between previously distinct media technologies and platforms—such as film, television, computers, telecommunications, and video games—all increasingly sharing digital formats and distribution channels like the internet.85 Globalization, facilitated by these technological advancements and more open trade policies, led to an increased international flow of media content, capital, and labor.88\nOne manifestation of this convergence was the increasingly symbiotic relationship between the film and digital games industries. The 1990s saw video game companies adopting global commercial strategies similar to Hollywood, and extensive cross-licensing of intellectual property (IP) became",

The 1990s saw video game companies adopting global commercial strategies similar to Hollywood, and extensive cross-licensing of intellectual property (IP) became common, with popular films being adapted into video games and successful game franchises inspiring film adaptations.85 This led to the rise of multi-platform entertainment franchises, where stories and characters were extended across various media to maximize audience engagement and revenue.87\nHowever, these interconnected trends also gave rise to various forms of \"global discontent\":\n* Cultural Homogenization and Imperialism: A primary concern was that the increased global reach of Hollywood films and other Western media products, facilitated by digital distribution, could lead to a homogenization of global culture, marginalizing local film industries and cultural expressions in other countries.85 The dominance of a few transnational media corporations in global distribution networks made it difficult for smaller, indigenous film industries to compete, even in their own domestic markets, as exemplified by the struggles of the Irish film industry detailed by Kerr and Flynn.85\n* Economic Disparities and Labor Issues: The globalization of film production led to the phenomenon of \"runaway productions,\" where film and television projects moved to countries or regions offering lower labor costs, tax incentives, or government subsidies.91 While this could benefit local economies in the short term, it often led to job losses and wage pressures in traditional production centers and raised concerns about labor standards and exploitation in the new production locales.\n* Intellectual Property and Piracy: The ease of digital reproduction and distribution via the internet also fueled a massive increase in film piracy.92 Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks and illicit streaming sites made unauthorized copies of films widely available, leading to significant revenue losses for copyright holders and challenging traditional distribution models.92\n* Emergence of Algorithmic Culture and Filter Bubbles: While the full impact of algorithmic content curation would become more apparent with the rise of streaming services in the following decade, the technological infrastructure and data collection practices established during this period laid the groundwork. Early concerns began to surface about how personalized digital platforms might create \"filter bubbles\" or \"echo chambers,\" limiting users' exposure to diverse perspectives and potentially reinforcing existing biases, thereby impacting cultural discourse and content diversity.86 The mainstream discourse, often shaped by powerful media entities, could be amplified in these digital ecosystems.88\nThe digital transformation, therefore, presented a paradox: while it offered democratizing potential by lowering barriers to entry for content creation and providing new tools for filmmakers 13, it also facilitated greater consolidation of power by major media conglomerates who could leverage their IP globally across converging platforms.85 This tension between decentralization and centralization, access and control, continues to shape the film industry in the 21st century.\nWeek 10: The Rise of the Internet and Streaming (2000s–2010s)\nThe 2000s and 2010s witnessed the internet evolve from a nascent platform for information and communication into a dominant force in media distribution and consumption, profoundly reshaping the American film industry. The rise of online distribution platforms, spearheaded by companies like Netflix, marked a decisive shift from physical media to digital streaming, altering consumer behavior, revenue models, and even the nature of taste-making.\nOnline Distribution Platforms\nThe early 2000s saw the internet begin to disrupt traditional film distribution channels, primarily through illicit means. Peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks like Napster (initially for music, but the model extended to films via platforms like BitTorrent) allowed users to download and share copyrighted movies without authorization, posing a significant challenge to the industry's revenue streams.92 These platforms highlighted a growing consumer demand for on-demand access to content, even if the initial means were illegal.93\nLegitimate online distribution began to take shape as internet speeds increased and digital rights management (DRM) technologies evolved. Early efforts included digital downloads (electronic sell-through or EST) and video-on-demand (VOD) services offered by cable companies or platforms like Apple's iTunes Store. However, it was the advent of subscription-based streaming services that truly revolutionized online film distribution.\nNetflix, which began as a DVD-by-mail rental service in 1997, launched its streaming service in 2007.96 Initially offering a limited catalog of older films and TV shows, Netflix rapidly expanded its library and technological capabilities. Other major players soon emerged, including Hulu (initially a joint venture of major broadcasters focusing on TV content) and Amazon Prime Video (which bundled streaming with its broader Prime membership). These platforms offered subscribers access to a vast library of content for a flat monthly fee, fundamentally changing the economics of film consumption.97\nShift from Physical Media to Digital\nThe convenience, accessibility, and vast selection offered by streaming services accelerated a significant decline in the physical media market (DVDs and Blu-rays).97 Consumers increasingly favored the instant access of streaming over purchasing or renting discs.99 This shift had several implications:\n* Decline in Hardware and Retail: The demand for DVD and Blu-ray players waned, and manufacturers began to phase them out. Retailers dedicated less shelf space to physical media, further limiting its availability.99\n* Erosion of Ownership: A critical consequence of the shift to digital was the erosion of the concept of media ownership for consumers.99 When purchasing a DVD, consumers owned a physical copy they could keep indefinitely. With streaming, subscribers typically gain temporary access (a license) to content as long as they maintain their subscription and the content remains on the platform.99 Content could disappear from services due to licensing changes, and even \"purchased\" digital copies were often",

With streaming, subscribers typically gain temporary access (a license) to content as long as they maintain their subscription and the content remains on the platform.99 Content could disappear from services due to licensing changes, and even \"purchased\" digital copies were often licenses that could be revoked or become inaccessible.99\n* Increased Corporate Control: Streaming platforms gained significant control over content availability and access. Decisions about what content to feature, acquire, or remove were centralized within these companies, driven by their own content strategies and licensing agreements.99 This contrasted with the more decentralized physical media market where consumers could build personal libraries from a wide range of available titles.\nThis transition represented a fundamental change in the consumer-media relationship, moving from a model of tangible ownership to one of licensed access, with greater power concentrated in the hands of a few dominant digital platforms.99\nSubscription, Data, and the Long Tail\nThe business model of major streaming services like Netflix is primarily based on monthly subscriptions.96 Attracting and retaining subscribers became the key metric of success, replacing traditional box-office figures or individual unit sales as the primary driver for these new media giants.102\nCentral to this subscription model is the extensive collection and analysis of user data.96 Streaming platforms track what users watch, when they watch, what they search for, how they rate content, and even when they pause or abandon a film or show. This vast amount of data is used to:\n* Personalize Recommendations: Sophisticated algorithms analyze user behavior to provide individualized content suggestions, aiming to keep users engaged and satisfied with the service.96\n* Inform Content Acquisition and Production: Data insights guide decisions about which existing films and shows to license and, crucially, what types of original content to produce.96 Netflix, for example, famously used data on viewing habits to greenlight its first major original series, House of Cards.90\nStreaming platforms also leveraged the \"long tail\" concept, a term popularized by Chris Anderson.96 Unlike physical retailers with limited shelf space, digital platforms could offer a virtually limitless catalog of content, including niche films, older titles, and foreign productions that might not find wide distribution in traditional channels.96 While individual long-tail titles might have small audiences, collectively they could attract and retain a significant number of subscribers with diverse tastes.96 This ability to cater to niche interests was a key differentiator from the blockbuster-focused theatrical market and the limited selection of traditional video stores.\nHow Netflix Changed Taste-Making\nNetflix, in particular, has had a profound impact on taste-making and content consumption patterns 101:\n* Algorithmic Curation and Filter Bubbles: While Netflix's recommendation algorithms aim to surface content users will enjoy, critics argue they can also create \"filter bubbles\" or \"echo chambers\".94 By primarily showing users content similar to what they've already watched, the system may limit exposure to diverse genres, styles, or perspectives, potentially narrowing rather than broadening tastes over time.100 There are concerns that these algorithms may inadvertently reproduce existing societal biases in terms of what content is promoted or remains hidden.100 The sheer volume of content, combined with algorithmic guidance, means that a significant percentage of viewing choices 100 are influenced by the platform's suggestions, giving Netflix considerable power as a cultural gatekeeper.\n* Popularization of Binge-Watching: Netflix pioneered the practice of releasing entire seasons of its original series at once, rather than in a traditional weekly episodic format.101 This facilitated \"binge-watching,\" a new mode of intensive, serialized content consumption that has become a cultural norm.102\n* Globalization of Content and Democratization of Creation: Netflix has invested heavily in producing and acquiring local content from various countries around the world (e.g., Money Heist from Spain, Dark from Germany, Squid Game from South Korea) and giving these productions a global platform.102 This has led to the international success of non-English language content on an unprecedented scale, arguably democratizing content creation and exposing global audiences to a wider range of stories and cultural perspectives.102\n* Influence on Production Standards: Netflix's data-driven approach to content development and its willingness to invest in diverse genres and niche projects have influenced production trends across the industry.100 Some argue this leads to a \"capitalization of culture,\" where content is increasingly tailored to proven formulas or demographic targets identified by data, potentially at the expense of more experimental or challenging artistic visions.100 The platform's emphasis on subscriber growth over traditional metrics like box office has also shifted the financial incentives and risk assessment for film and television production.102\nThe rise of internet streaming, with Netflix at its forefront, represents one of the most significant disruptions in the history of the American film industry, fundamentally altering how films are distributed, financed, consumed, and culturally valued.\nWeek 11: Globalization and International Markets\nThe American film industry, particularly Hollywood, has long been a global force, but the dynamics of its international presence have evolved significantly, especially with technological advancements and changing geopolitical landscapes. This week examines the expansion of American films abroad, the rise of international co-productions, and the ongoing tensions between Hollywood's global dominance and local film industries seeking to protect and promote their own cultural products.\nExpansion of American Films Abroad\nFrom its early days, the American film industry recognized the potential of international markets. By the mid-1920s, Hollywood studios had already established a global distribution network that other national film industries struggled to match.85 This early expansion was aided by factors such as the disruption of European film production during World War I, which allowed U.S. producers to fill the void.85 The Motion Picture Export Association (MPEA), established in 1945, played a crucial role in coordinating the distribution",

By the mid-1920s, Hollywood studios had already established a global distribution network that other national film industries struggled to match.85 This early expansion was aided by factors such as the disruption of European film production during World War I, which allowed U.S. producers to fill the void.85 The Motion Picture Export Association (MPEA), established in 1945, played a crucial role in coordinating the distribution of Hollywood films overseas, initially focusing on markets like Japan and Europe between 1950 and 1970.89\nThe latter half of the 20th century and the early 21st century saw an intensification of Hollywood's global expansion, driven by several factors:\n* Opening of New Markets: The gradual opening of previously closed or restricted markets, such as South Korea in the 1980s and 1990s, and later China, provided vast new audiences for American films.67 By the 1990s, Hollywood products accounted for nearly half of South Korea's national market share.89\n* Economic Imperative: As domestic box office attendance in the U.S. faced stagnation or decline (falling by 25% between 2002 and 2019, pre-pandemic), international markets became increasingly vital for Hollywood's profitability.90 Studios came to earn as much as three-quarters of their total box office receipts from overseas.90 Movies that underperformed domestically could still become financially successful through strong international performance, as exemplified by James Cameron's Avatar.90\n* Evolution of Distribution Channels: The advent of new distribution technologies, from television and pay-TV channels in the 1980s and 1990s to VHS, DVD, and eventually global streaming platforms, allowed Hollywood content to reach broader international audiences more rapidly and efficiently.89\n* Content Tailoring and \"Pre-Sold\" Properties: Hollywood increasingly developed blockbuster franchise films with themes, spectacle, and stars designed for broad global appeal, particularly targeting large markets like China.67 This sometimes involved re-editing films, adding scenes with local actors, or altering content during scripting to cater to specific international audience preferences or censorship requirements (e.g., changes to Skyfall or Iron Man 3 for the Chinese market).67 The reliance on \"pre-sold\" properties (sequels, adaptations of globally recognized books or comics) also facilitated easier marketing in diverse cultural contexts.85\nThis expansion, however, has not been without criticism, with concerns raised about American cultural influence and the economic impact on local film industries.89\nCo-productions and International Collaborations\nInternational co-productions, where film projects are jointly financed and produced by entities from two or more countries, have become an increasingly important feature of the global film landscape.105 These collaborations offer several strategic benefits:\n* Access to Funding and Resources: Co-productions allow filmmakers to pool financial resources from multiple territories, often tapping into national film funds, tax incentives, and private investment available in partner countries.105 This can enable the production of films with larger budgets or more ambitious scope than might be possible with purely domestic funding. Tax incentives, in particular, can significantly reduce the overall financial burden for filmmakers and studios.105\n* Market Access and Distribution: Partnering with international entities can facilitate smoother distribution and marketing of a film in the co-producing countries, leveraging local knowledge, networks, and distribution channels.105 Films that qualify as official co-productions under bilateral treaties often benefit from being treated as national films in each partner country, gaining access to local exhibition quotas and subsidies.106\n* Creative and Talent Exchange: Co-productions can foster creative collaboration by bringing together talent (directors, writers, actors, technicians) from different cultural backgrounds, potentially enriching the storytelling and enhancing the film's appeal to diverse international audiences.105 They also provide access to a wider range of locations and production expertise.105\n* Cultural Diplomacy: Successful co-productions can serve as a form of cultural diplomacy, fostering understanding and cooperation between nations through the shared experience of filmmaking.105 Examples like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (a Taiwan-China-Hong Kong-US co-production) demonstrate the creative and commercial potential of such collaborations.105\nDespite these benefits, international co-productions present significant challenges. These include navigating complex legal and financial frameworks across multiple jurisdictions, reconciling different production practices and labor regulations, overcoming language barriers, and managing cultural differences in creative approaches and storytelling sensibilities.105 Maintaining a cohesive artistic vision while balancing the input and interests of various international partners requires careful negotiation and strong project management.106 Treaty co-productions, governed by formal agreements between countries, often provide a more structured framework and access to specific benefits, while non-treaty co-productions may offer more flexibility but fewer official advantages.106\nHollywood vs. the World: Platforms and Protectionism\nThe global dominance of Hollywood has long been a point of contention, leading to various responses from other countries aimed at protecting and promoting their domestic film industries and cultural identities.85\n* Hollywood's Global Reach: American films, particularly large-scale blockbusters, often dominate international box offices due to their substantial production budgets, sophisticated marketing campaigns, established global distribution networks, and widespread cultural appeal.90 Streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+, largely originating from the U.S., have further extended the global reach of American content.90\n* Protectionist Measures: Many countries have implemented protectionist measures to support their local film industries and counter Hollywood's influence. These can include:\n   * Screen Quotas: Mandating that a certain percentage of screen time in cinemas be allocated to domestic films (e.g., South Korea's historical screen quotas 109, France's support for French-language films 110).\n   * Subsidies and Tax Incentives: Providing government funding, grants, and tax breaks for the production of local films.107 France, for example, has a long history of subsidizing its",

China, for instance, has historically used a quota system for foreign film imports and has more recently pursued a strategy of \"decoupling\" from Hollywood to build its national film industry, sometimes employing protectionist measures against Hollywood imports.108\n   * Dubbing/Language Quotas: Requiring films to be dubbed into the local language or imposing quotas on foreign-language films to support local language productions.110\n* Effectiveness and Critiques of Protectionism: The effectiveness of protectionist measures is debated. While they can provide short-term support for local production, some studies suggest that subsidies and quotas may not always lead to higher quality films or sustainable industries, and can sometimes distort the market.110 For example, subsidies might inadvertently increase actors' performance fees or favor established directors over new talent.110 However, without such measures, many argue that local film cultures would be overwhelmed by the financial and marketing power of Hollywood.85\n* The Rise of Local Content: In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend in some countries (e.g., Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, China) where local films are gaining a larger share of their domestic box office, sometimes outperforming Hollywood imports.108 This suggests a growing appetite for locally relevant stories and a strengthening of national film industries, partly due to decreased production and distribution costs globally, and strategic industry development.108\n* The Platform Era: Global streaming platforms, while often seen as vehicles for Hollywood content, have also invested in local original productions in many countries (e.g., Netflix Originals from various regions 102). This creates new opportunities for local creators but also raises questions about the platforms' influence on content and the terms of trade for local production companies.\nThe relationship between Hollywood and global film industries remains complex, characterized by American commercial strength, efforts by other nations to nurture their own cinematic voices, and the evolving role of global digital platforms in shaping content creation and consumption worldwide. This dynamic reflects ongoing tensions between globalization and cultural sovereignty, commercial imperatives and artistic diversity.\nWeek 12: The Impact of Social Media and Fan Culture\nThe rise of social media platforms and the increasing organization and vocality of fan cultures have introduced new dynamics into the American film industry. These forces have reshaped film marketing, fostered direct engagement between creators and audiences, enabled new funding models like crowdfunding, and given fans unprecedented influence—and sometimes control—over film franchises and narratives.\nDirect Engagement Between Creators and Audiences\nSocial media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter (now X), and TikTok have fundamentally altered the communication channels between filmmakers, studios, and their audiences.111 Traditionally, film marketing was a largely one-way street, with studios disseminating promotional materials through established media channels.111 Social media has transformed this into an interactive process.111\nFilmmakers, actors, and studios can now engage directly with fans in real-time, sharing behind-the-scenes content, participating in Q&A sessions, responding to comments, and building a sense of community around a film or franchise.112 This direct interaction can humanize the filmmaking process, foster loyalty, and generate organic buzz.112 For instance, the marketing for the movie Deadpool (2016) utilized sarcastic and humorous Twitter posts to build its brand and make fans feel like part of the film's journey.111 This engagement allows for immediate feedback, helping creators understand audience preferences and expectations, and can even influence marketing strategies as they evolve.112\nCrowdfunding and Fan-Driven Content\nThe internet and social media have facilitated new models for financing films, most notably crowdfunding. Platforms like Kickstarter have enabled filmmakers, particularly independent creators, to bypass traditional funding structures (studios, private investors) and appeal directly to fans and the public for financial backing.114 This model allows creators to maintain more artistic control and prove audience demand for projects that might be considered too niche or risky by conventional financiers.114\nNumerous films, ranging from short films to features and documentaries, have been successfully funded through crowdfunding campaigns. Matthew A. Cherry's animated short film Hair Love, which won an Academy Award, raised over $284,000 on Kickstarter, a record for an animated short at the time.114 Other Kickstarter-funded films like An Irish Goodbye and Period. End of Sentence. have also won Oscars, demonstrating the viability of crowdfunding for producing critically acclaimed work.114 The success of such campaigns often relies on effectively leveraging social media to reach potential backers, offering engaging rewards, and building a community around the project.115 Crowdfunding not only provides financial support but also serves as a powerful marketing tool, generating early awareness and a built-in audience invested in the film's success. This democratizes the filmmaking process to some extent, allowing projects to be greenlit by audience enthusiasm rather than solely by industry gatekeepers.114\nPlatform Fandom and Control: YouTube and Reddit Case Studies\nOnline platforms like YouTube and Reddit have become major hubs for fan communities, where enthusiasts congregate to discuss films, share theories, create fan-made content (fan films, edits, reviews), and organize campaigns. These platforms amplify fan voices and can exert significant influence on the perception and trajectory of film franchises.\n* YouTube: Serves as a primary platform for official trailers and promotional content, but also hosts a vast ecosystem of fan-generated content,",

Influencer collaborations on YouTube have become a key marketing strategy, particularly for reaching younger demographics.111\n* Reddit: Subreddits dedicated to specific films, franchises, or genres (e.g., r/StarWars, r/MarvelStudios, r/movies) are vibrant communities where fans dissect news, debate plot points, share artwork, and organize collective actions. These forums can become powerful incubators of fan sentiment, capable of driving narratives about a film's quality or a franchise's direction.116\nThe power of these organized fan communities can be a double-edged sword for studios:\n* Positive Impact (Fan Activism & Support): Passionate fan campaigns have, in some instances, successfully influenced studio decisions. Letter-writing campaigns saved the original Star Trek series from early cancellation and led to its flourishing in syndication and subsequent spin-offs.117 The fan campaign for Firefly led to the creation of the follow-up movie Serenity.117 More recently, the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut campaign, largely organized on social media, pressured Warner Bros. to release Zack Snyder's version of Justice League. These examples show that dedicated fan bases can act as powerful advocates, sometimes even reviving or reshaping content.113 Brands that successfully tap into and service the needs of these fandoms can cultivate deep consumer loyalty and drive sales.119\n* Negative Impact (Toxicity and Unrealistic Demands): However, fan communities can also become sources of intense negativity or \"toxic fandom\".116 Entitled or overly zealous fan groups can engage in harassment of creators or actors, demand unrealistic changes to established canon, or create divisive environments that alienate broader audiences or even other fans.116 The passionate reactions to critiques of Marvel films by acclaimed directors, or the intense debates and sometimes hostile behavior within segments of the Star Wars fanbase, illustrate this potential downside.116 Studios may find themselves in a difficult position, trying to appease dedicated fans while also maintaining creative integrity and appealing to a wider market.\nThe rise of social media and platform-based fandom has undeniably empowered audiences, giving them a more direct and influential role in the lifecycle of films and franchises. This has created new opportunities for engagement and funding but also new challenges for creators and studios in navigating the complex and sometimes volatile landscape of online fan culture.\nWeek 13: The COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Aftermath\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in early 2020, triggered an unprecedented global crisis that profoundly disrupted the American film industry across all sectors, from production to distribution and exhibition. It accelerated pre-existing trends, particularly the shift towards streaming, and forced a radical re-evaluation of traditional business models, theatrical windows, and the very nature of the cinematic experience.\nDisruption of Traditional Distribution Channels\nThe most immediate and visible impact of the pandemic was the widespread closure of movie theaters worldwide to curb the spread of the virus.120 This brought theatrical distribution, the cornerstone of the film industry's revenue model for over a century, to a virtual standstill.120 Major blockbuster releases slated for 2020 and 2021 were repeatedly postponed or pulled from the schedule, leading to massive financial losses for both studios and exhibitors.120 Global box office revenue plummeted from $42.5 billion in 2019 to just $12.4 billion in 2020.120\nFilm production also faced immediate and extensive halts as studios suspended ongoing projects to implement health and safety protocols.122 This created a significant disruption in the content pipeline, with delays in the completion and release of new films.122 The entire ecosystem, from A-list productions to independent films, was affected.\nAcceleration of Streaming Adoption\nWith theaters closed and populations under stay-at-home orders, audiences turned en masse to streaming services for entertainment.120 Platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and HBO Max saw a dramatic surge in subscriptions and viewing hours.120 Netflix alone added millions of new subscribers globally during the initial phases of the pandemic.120 The number of subscriptions to online video streaming services worldwide reached 1.1 billion in 2020.120\nThis rapid acceleration of streaming adoption was not merely a temporary shift but solidified streaming as a dominant mode of content consumption.120 Studios, facing an uncertain future for theatrical releases and needing to generate revenue from completed films, began to experiment with alternative distribution strategies:\n* Direct-to-Streaming Releases: Some films bypassed theatrical release altogether and premiered directly on streaming platforms. Disney, for example, released films like Mulan (via premium VOD on Disney+) and Soul directly to its subscribers.97\n* Hybrid Releases (Day-and-Date): A more controversial strategy involved releasing films simultaneously in theaters (where available) and on streaming services. Warner Bros. made headlines by announcing that its entire 2021 film slate would debut day-and-date on HBO Max and in cinemas.120 This move, while aimed at bolstering HBO Max subscriptions and providing content to home-bound audiences, strained relationships with theatrical exhibitors and some filmmakers who prioritized the traditional theatrical experience.\nVirtual Festivals and the Death of Theatrical Windows?\nThe pandemic also forced film festivals, crucial platforms for independent film discovery, sales, and industry networking, to adapt. Many major festivals like Cannes, Tribeca, and SXSW were cancelled or postponed in 2020, while others, such as Sheffield",

Many major festivals like Cannes, Tribeca, and SXSW were cancelled or postponed in 2020, while others, such as Sheffield, Sarajevo, and HotDocs, pivoted to online or hybrid models, offering virtual screenings, panels, and industry markets.124 This allowed festivals to continue their activities and reach global audiences, but also raised questions about the long-term viability and impact of virtual versus in-person festival experiences.\nA significant consequence of these pandemic-driven distribution shifts was the dramatic compression, and in some cases, near-elimination, of traditional theatrical windows.120 Historically, theaters enjoyed an exclusive window of typically 70-90 days (or more) before a film would become available on other platforms like home video or VOD.97 The pandemic forced studios to shorten these windows drastically. Some films became available on premium video-on-demand (PVOD) just weeks after their theatrical debut, or as part of day-and-date streaming releases.120 For example, Bong Joon Ho's Mickey 17 125 was noted to begin streaming just 32 days after its theatrical release, a trend driven by underperforming box office for some films and the studios' need to supply content to their own streaming services.125\nWhile some predicted the \"death\" of the exclusive theatrical window, the post-pandemic landscape has seen a more nuanced evolution. As theaters reopened, some studios have sought to re-establish a period of theatrical exclusivity, particularly for major blockbusters, recognizing the revenue potential of a successful theatrical run and the prestige associated with it. However, the windows are generally shorter and more flexible than before the pandemic, with studios often making decisions on a film-by-film basis depending on box office performance and streaming service needs.125 The power dynamic between studios and exhibitors has shifted, with studios (many of whom now own major streaming platforms) having more leverage to dictate release terms.\nResilience and Reinvention in a Locked-Down Industry\nDespite the immense challenges, the film industry demonstrated resilience and a capacity for reinvention.122\n* Production Adaptations: To resume filming, comprehensive health and safety protocols were developed in collaboration with industry unions. These included regular COVID-19 testing, mandatory PPE, social distancing on set, and sometimes \"bubble\" environments for cast and crew.122 Production practices were adapted, with some scenes rewritten to minimize close contact and an increased use of remote technologies for pre-production and post-production.122\n* Exhibitor Innovation: Theaters, when able to reopen, implemented their own safety measures (capacity limits, enhanced cleaning, contactless ticketing) and explored new ways to attract audiences, such as private screen rentals and diversified programming.\n* Focus on Streaming Content: The demand for content on streaming platforms fueled continued production, albeit under new safety constraints. Streaming services became even more central to studio strategies, not just as distribution outlets but as primary drivers of content creation.123\nThe COVID-19 pandemic acted as an accelerant for changes already underway in the film industry, particularly the ascendance of streaming and the re-evaluation of traditional distribution models. While the immediate crisis phase has passed, its long-term effects on consumer behavior, studio-exhibitor relationships, and the financial structure of filmmaking continue to shape the industry's future.120 The industry that emerged is one more reliant on digital platforms, with more flexible (and often shorter) theatrical windows, and a greater emphasis on direct-to-consumer strategies.\nWeek 14: The 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA Strikes and Labor Movements\nThe year 2023 was marked by significant labor unrest in Hollywood, as both the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) engaged in lengthy, overlapping strikes against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents major studios and streaming services. These dual strikes brought much of the American film and television industry to a halt, highlighting critical issues at the intersection of creative labor, technological change, and evolving business models.\nDual Strike Impact: 148-day WGA Strike and 118-day SAG-AFTRA Strike\nThe WGA initiated its strike on May 2, 2023, lasting for 148 days until a tentative agreement was reached on September 24 and the strike officially ended on September 27, 2023.126 SAG-AFTRA, representing actors, joined the writers on strike on July 14, 2023, after their own negotiations with the AMPTP failed. The actors' strike lasted for 118 days, ending with a tentative agreement on November 8 and officially concluding on November 9, 2023.126 This was the first time since 1960 that both writers and actors had been on strike simultaneously, and the SAG-AFTRA strike was the longest in its history against film and TV studios.128\nThe combined impact of these strikes was substantial, causing the largest interruption to American film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic [127,\nWorks cited\n1.

It begins by examining the technological preconditions and the competing inventive models of Thomas Edison and the Lumière brothers, which established cinema as both a private novelty and a public spectacle. The narrative follows the medium's evolution from simple \"actualities\" seen in vaudeville houses to the dawn of complex storytelling with Edwin S. Porter's landmark film, The Great Train Robbery. This shift in content, combined with the rise of the Nickelodeon, created a new mass audience of urban, working-class, and immigrant moviegoers.\nThe pedagogical goal of this chapter is to demonstrate how this burgeoning art form was rapidly industrialized. We will analyze the formation of the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), an aggressive trust that sought to monopolize the industry through patent control. Ultimately, the chapter shows how resistance to this monopoly from \"Independent\" filmmakers led directly to the decline of the East Coast-based Trust and the strategic relocation of production to a small suburb called Hollywood, setting the stage for the classical studio era.\nKey Terms\nFigures:\n* Thomas Edison\n* W.K.L.

Porter\n* Eadweard Muybridge\nFilms & Technologies:\n* The Kiss (1896)\n* Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory (1895)\n* The Great Train Robbery (1903)\n* Kinetoscope\n* Cinématographe\n* Celluloid film stock\nCompanies, Institutions & Concepts:\n* Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC)\n* Edison Manufacturing Company\n* Biograph Company\n* Nickelodeon\n* Vaudeville\n* Patent law enforcement\n* Sherman Antitrust Act\n* \"The Independents\"\n* Hollywood\n* Audience Shifts (Immigrant/Working-Class)\n* Cultural Flashpoints\n* Critical Reception (Novelty vs. Art)\nChapter 1: The Birth of an Industry: American Cinema from Invention to Hollywood's Rise (1890s-1915)\nI. Introduction: The Scientific Dream of Living Pictures\nThe story of American cinema begins not in a theater, but in the workshops and laboratories of the late 19th century. This section sets the stage by examining the cultural desire for visual spectacle and the scientific breakthroughs that made moving pictures possible. We will touch upon the foundational motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey, whose experiments in serial photography first decomposed and reanimated movement, proving the concepts that inventors would soon commercialize. This era was driven by a scientific and popular fascination with capturing reality in motion.\nII. The Race to Invent: Competing Models of Cinema\nHere, we explore the invention of the motion picture camera and projector through its two pioneering, and fundamentally different, models.\n* A. Edison’s Kinetoscope: Cinema as a Private Experience. In the United States, Thomas Edison, alongside his lead engineer W.K.L. Dickson, developed the Kinetoscope. This was not a projection system but a \"peephole\" device for individual viewing. Their work, reliant on the flexible celluloid film stock developed by George Eastman, established an early, contained model for cinema as a commercial novelty. The Edison Manufacturing Company began producing short films in their specialized studio, \"The Black Maria,\" to supply these machines, which populated arcades and parlors.\n* B. The Lumière Cinématographe: Cinema as a Public Spectacle. In France, brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière created the Cinématographe, a revolutionary all-in-one device that could shoot, develop, and, most importantly, project films. Their public screening in Paris in December 1895, featuring films like Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory, marks the birth of the theatrical, communal experience that would come to define cinema. This model was quickly imported to the U.S., setting up a direct conflict with Edison’s approach.\nIII. Early Content: From Actuality to Narrative Stirrings\nThis section examines the content of the first films, which were initially non-fiction \"actualities\" or brief, staged scenes. These short films became popular attractions in vaudeville circuits, where they were presented as one act among many. It is in this context that one of the first Cultural Flashpoints occurred with Edison's film, The Kiss (1896). The simple depiction of a brief kiss caused a minor scandal, demonstrating from the very beginning cinema's power to challenge social norms and generate public debate. Early Critical Reception focused on the technological marvel rather than artistic merit, viewing film as a scientific curiosity.\nIV. The Dawn of American Narrative: Edwin S. Porter\nThe novelty of moving images began to wane by the turn of the century, creating a demand for more engaging content. The crucial figure in this transition is Edison's director, Edwin S. Porter. After experimenting with multi-shot narratives, he created The Great Train Robbery (1903). This film was a landmark achievement that used techniques like cross-cutting (showing simultaneous action in different locations) and location shooting to tell a complex story. Its immense popularity proved that narrative films were the future and provided a blueprint for the \"story film\" that would dominate the market.\nV. The Nickelodeon Boom and the New Mass Audience\nAround 1905, a new form of exhibition transformed cinema into a true mass medium: the Nickelodeon. These were small, often converted storefront theaters that charged five cents for a program of short films. This business model was a runaway success for several reasons:\n* Audience Shifts: Nickelodeons catered directly to the burgeoning working-class and immigrant audiences in America's cities. The films were silent, overcoming language barriers, and the low price made them highly accessible.\n* Habitual Moviegoing: Unlike the novelty of",

The films were silent, overcoming language barriers, and the low price made them highly accessible.\n* Habitual Moviegoing: Unlike the novelty of vaudeville, nickelodeons fostered the habit of regular moviegoing, creating a stable, continuous demand for new film products and establishing the \"moviegoer.\"\nVI. Industrialization and Monopoly: The Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC)\nThe explosive growth of nickelodeons created a chaotic and fiercely competitive market. Thomas Edison, seeing others profiting from his patented technologies, embarked on aggressive legal actions to protect his patents. This culminated in the formation of the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), or \"The Trust,\" in 1908.\n* Consolidating Power: The MPPC was a consortium that pooled the patents of the major players, including the Edison Manufacturing Company, the Biograph Company (Edison's chief rival), and Eastman Kodak, which agreed to sell film stock only to MPPC members.\n* Controlling the Industry: Through patent law enforcement, the MPPC sought to control all three tiers of the industry: production, distribution, and exhibition. Unlicensed producers were sued, their equipment was seized, and theaters that showed non-MPPC films were denied access to \"Trust\" films.\nVII. Resistance and Relocation: The Independents and the Rise of Hollywood\nThe MPPC's monopolistic practices bred resentment and resistance from unlicensed filmmakers and exhibitors, who became known as \"Independents.\" Figures like Carl Laemmle, William Fox, and Adolph Zukor fought the Trust in court and in the marketplace. To escape the MPPC's legal reach and enforcers on the East Coast, these Independents began moving their operations to Southern California. This westward migration was strategic:\n* Distance: It was far from the MPPC's base in New Jersey.\n* Climate & Geography: The sunny weather allowed for year-round outdoor filming, and the diverse landscapes could stand in for almost any location in the world. This move laid the foundation for Hollywood to become the new center of American film production. The Independents also championed the \"star system\" and longer \"feature\" films—innovations the MPPC resisted—which proved immensely popular with audiences.\nVIII. The Fall of the Trust and the Dawn of a New Era\nThe federal government eventually took notice of the MPPC's anti-competitive practices. In a landmark case, the government sued the MPPC for being an illegal monopoly. In 1915, the Supreme Court ruled against the Trust, citing the Sherman Antitrust Act. The dissolution of the MPPC officially ended the foundational era of American cinema and cleared the way for the Independent producers, now based in Hollywood, to build the studio system that would dominate for the next several decades. This moment marks the final transition from vaudeville novelty to stand-alone film attractions, solidifying cinema's cultural and economic legitimacy.",

We examine how Hollywood's growing cultural power and a series of high-profile scandals provoked widespread calls for censorship. The industry's strategic response—the creation of the MPPDA (the \"Hays Office\") to enact self-regulation—is presented as a defining moment, establishing a system of internal control that would shape the content of American films for decades. By the end of this period, cinema had become a central American institution, with its business practices, artistic conventions, and social influence firmly established.\nKey Terms\nFigures:\n* D.W.

Introduction: From Independent Rebels to Studio Moguls\nThis chapter chronicles the maturation of American cinema, a period in which the \"Independent\" outsiders who fought the MPPC became the new, powerful establishment. Having established a foothold in Hollywood, these producers transformed their small companies into mighty industrial empires. We will examine how they created a stable oligopoly by standardizing not just technology and storytelling, but the very business of making and selling movies, turning filmmaking into a factory-like process and moviegoing into a national pastime.\nII. Codifying the Language of Cinema: D.W. Griffith\nThe artistic foundation for the studio era was laid by director D.W. Griffith. While he did not invent all narrative techniques, he was the master synthesizer who refined and combined them into the seamless style that would become known as continuity editing.\n* The Birth of a Nation (1915): This film is the era's most significant and notorious landmark. Its epic scale, dynamic editing, and sophisticated narrative techniques demonstrated cinema's immense emotional and persuasive power. However, its heroic portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan and racist ideology made it a major Cultural Flashpoint, sparking nationwide protests led by the NAACP and forcing a national conversation about cinema's social responsibility.\n* Intolerance (1916): Stung by the criticism, Griffith responded with this hugely ambitious film, weaving together four separate storylines across 2,500 years to plead for tolerance. While a commercial failure, its complex structure and grand scale showcased the limitless artistic ambition of the feature film.\nIII. The Architects of the Hollywood System: Zukor, Laemmle, and Fox\nWhile Griffith was refining cinema's art, a new generation of moguls was perfecting its business. These men built the institutions that would define Hollywood for decades.\n* Adolph Zukor and Paramount Pictures: Zukor was the era's chief industrial strategist. He built Paramount Pictures into a powerhouse through a strategy of Vertical Integration—controlling production, distribution, and exhibition. By owning theater chains, Zukor ensured an outlet for his studio's films.\n* Business Moves - Block Booking: To guarantee profits and dominate the market, Zukor perfected the tactic of block booking. This forced independent theater owners to buy a studio's entire annual slate of films (including less desirable \"B\" pictures) in order to get access to the top features with major stars.\n* The Rise of the Studios: Other moguls followed Zukor's lead. Carl Laemmle expanded Universal Pictures with a focus on genre films, while William Fox built the Fox Film Corporation. These studios, along with the burgeoning Warner Bros., formed the basis of a new Hollywood oligopoly.\nIV. The Star System and the Creation of the Movie Palace\nTo secure their audience and differentiate their product, the studios developed two powerful tools: stars and theaters.\n* The Star System: Figures like Mary Pickford (\"America's Sweetheart\"), Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks became the industry's most valuable assets. Studios institutionalized celebrity by placing stars under restrictive, long-term contracts, carefully managing their public image, and creating films tailored to their personas. This system manufactured audience loyalty and provided a powerful marketing hook.\n* Audience Shifts: The studios targeted a growing middle-class audience by building opulent \"movie palaces.\" These luxurious theaters, with their ornate architecture and uniformed ushers, transformed moviegoing from a cheap amusement into a prestigious event, further legitimizing cinema as a mainstream entertainment form.\nV. The Hollywood Factory: Standardization and Style\nWith the business structure in place, production itself became highly organized and standardized. The \"studio system\" operated like an assembly line to ensure a consistent and predictable",

The Hollywood Factory: Standardization and Style\nWith the business structure in place, production itself became highly organized and standardized. The \"studio system\" operated like an assembly line to ensure a consistent and predictable product.\n* Technologies of Control: The development of powerful studio lighting rigs allowed for shooting to move indoors, freeing production from the whims of weather and allowing for the creation of more controlled, artificial worlds.\n* The Rise of Genre and the Director-Unit System: Studios specialized in genres (Westerns, melodramas, comedies) and assigned producers to oversee different units. Directors like Cecil B. DeMille became masters of the polished studio style. His film The Cheat (1915), with its sophisticated lighting, lavish sets, and provocative themes of sex and race, epitomized the high-gloss, controversial, and commercially successful product of the mature studio system.\nVI. Scandal, Censorship, and Self-Regulation\nHollywood's growing influence and the provocative content of its films led to significant public backlash.\n* Hollywood on Trial: A series of high-profile Hollywood scandals in the early 1920s—including the murder of director William Desmond Taylor and the sensationalized manslaughter trials of comedian Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle—cemented a public perception of Hollywood as a den of sin.\n* Legislation & Policy: Moral reformers and religious groups, fueled by these scandals, called for federal censorship of motion pictures. Fearing government intervention that would harm their business, the studio heads acted preemptively.\n* The Hays Office: In 1922, the moguls formed a trade association, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA), and appointed Presbyterian elder Will H. Hays as its head. The \"Hays Office\" was designed to be an internal arbiter of morality, implementing policies and pressuring studios to tone down content to placate critics and fend off official censorship. This marked a crucial step in the industry's long history of self-regulation.",

just raise the price.\nSo like, okay.\nRight.\nSo that generates some money, has a lot of the work, a lot of the content is already there.\nYeah.\nIt just has to be presented by, or we just have to add.\nAnd that's why I, you know, the Socratic method thing is one obvious thing to do, is to just run through the content with the chat bot that does this with the student.\nNow, the trick would be keeping track of how well they do, which apparently a lot of the chat bots don't do very well, particularly in ChatGPT.\nI, reading about it, it said that it will test the student and it will, you know, but it won't calculate the correct answers correctly.\nIt can't count the correct answers.\nThat's so strange.\nYeah, isn't it?\nOkay.\nSo do you see what?\nYeah, I'm tracking with you 100%.\nSo that all contributes to the overall primer thing.\nAnd the attention, keeping attention with like subway surfers or something like that.\nYeah.\nTricks like that while they're doing this interaction.\nOr, and the educational method being what you described with the Minecraft thing.\nOr, okay, you're doing this thing that you can do while you're listening and it helps you remember.\nNow, why is that?\nWhy does that?\nThat's supported in research.\nUh-huh.\nDid you read the Thousand Brain book?\nI read like, I'm halfway through.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nBecause in there, it talks about how these things, how these models are linked together.\nYeah.\nAnd it talks about the mind map.\nYeah.\nYou know, for when you like map things you want to remember in your head.\nIt's almost like, it's a physical, for me at least, like, because when I was reading about the mind map, my Minecraft is like a physical manifestation of the mind map.\nThat house is associated with that fact.\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nYour Minecraft thing.\nYeah, yeah.\nExactly.\nLike, it's like, it's, I mean, from an interesting perspective, like my parents were doing it right then.\nMm-hmm.\nWithout knowing that they were doing it right.\nYeah, yeah.\nSo how do we implement that?\nSo do you think though, just for conversation's sake, like I am highly neurodivergent, right?\nMm-hmm.\nNot to like bring out like local labels, but like I've had the testing done.\nMm-hmm.",

like I've had the testing done.\nMm-hmm.\nI do have like neuroses.\nMm-hmm.\nCan, does a neurotypical person have that same response?\nOr are we at the point that like we are also fried by our iPads that everyone is?\nEverybody's addicted.\nUh, practically every student is addicted to, if they've got to keep scrolling.\nIt's an addiction.\nIt's a dopamine hit.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo use it.\nDoes the, and does the mind map work?\nYes.\nDoes it, is it, um, easier to have a game present you, create the mind map?\nOr do you, like if it says, oh, make a mind map in your head to remember these things.\nThat's hard.\nOr.\nBuild it.\nPlay this game while you listen to this.\nSo.\nThe game's easier.\nIt's easier.\nLike I think of it.\nOkay.\nSo I've been, I've been playing this.\nWhat else do you play?\nWhat other games do you play?\nI play like these very simple.\nSo like I.\nOkay.\nI watch a lot of TV.\nRight.\nOkay.\nBecause I can't sit in silence.\nYeah.\nMaybe I'm either working on our stuff.\nMm-hmm.\nOr if my brain hurts too much, I'm playing like a stupid game.\nRight.\nAnd so like right now, very recently I've been playing like this fruit popping game.\nOkay.\nThere's, we could totally recreate this.\nUm.\nAnd I like it so much that I've almost paid $8 for the ad free version.\nMm-hmm.\nI haven't done that yet because I'm, don't have money.\nBut, um, when the app, like all I'm doing is like you build the fruits together.\nMm-hmm.\nTo try to fill this box without overfilling the box.\nRight.\nAnd while I was playing this game, I was watching our friends and neighbors on Apple TV Plus.\nI have a better comprehension of that show because I was playing this game.\nNow, because it isn't like Minecraft where I'm explicitly like doing a task, I don't know the same level of association.\nMm-hmm.\nBut I do associate this game with that show now.\nOkay.\nAnd so like, let's say that I was trying to study.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd let's say that I was being tested on that show.\nIn order to study more productively, I would just play the game because it reminds me of the show.\nMm-hmm.\nI'm thinking of the show now.\nOh, and then like in episode seven, they did this.\nOh, and now I'm going to go back to this part in episode seven.\nMm-hmm.\nYou know?\nYeah.\nSo part of it is remembering in general versus going through all the concepts you need to know.\nYes.\nBecause, well, and that's true learning, right?\nYeah.\nLike common core is a list of concepts.\nMm-hmm.\nVersus like a general comprehension of what happened.\nLike the ultimate, and maybe this is like a teaching tactic, the ultimate test of comprehension is the ability to teach.\nSo let's say somewhere in the primer you're given an agent and your job is to teach the agent the concept.\nMm-hmm.\nYou know, like you're presented with a problem.\nLike even just like, okay, reading the ICPC sets.\nYeah.\nYou know?\nYeah.\nYou are teaching John this.\nMm-hmm.\nJohn learns best from this, this, and this.\nJohn is X years old.\nDa-da-da-da-da.\nYou need to teach him X concept.\nAnd then your job is to teach the agent.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd that's the test.\nLike let's say instead of taking a written test.\nYeah.\nYour job is how well can you train this agent to know the knowledge.\nMm-hmm.\nSo that's like a little bit off track.\nNo, no.\nAnd so based on the score that your agent passes the test, that's how well you did because you taught it.\nSo now you've mastered it to the level that you can train an agent.\nMm-hmm.\nYou know?\nCircling back to like apps like Headway.\nMm-hmm.\nSo they have a lot of cool stuff.\nWhere we and where my thesis work with the Lizzy Project comes in is we have the foundation for a product that we can upload our own content\nand have it broken down into bite-sized chunks.\nMm-hmm.\nSo Headway has a preset library, whereas our app is, you know, on the free tier you can download, you can upload X much content to be studied.\nAnd then you pay $5 a month and you get X content to be studied, but you can upload it and have it turned into content bite-sized for you.\nSo what we're offering is a service that breaks down long-form content into a bite-sized personalized curriculum that you can just play 15 minutes a day on your phone.\nSo like let's say that you wanted to learn film history.\nMm-hmm.\nYou upload all the content, you give it a goal, and our agents work behind the scenes to curate this bite-sized curriculum for you.\nHow much time do you have to spend a day?\nHow long do you want to work on this?\nAre you doing this for fun or for school?\nMm-hmm.\nYou know, all these different variables, which in the NEL 2 beta we're already working on expanding the variables.\nMm-hmm.\nMm-hmm.\nWe process",

variables.\nMm-hmm.\nMm-hmm.\nWe process this into a customized learning program for you, and then you work through it.\nMm-hmm.\nYou know?\nYeah, yeah.\nLike what do you think of that?\nSo then we hit the market of students.\nWe can test it in your classroom.\nThey get the free access or they get a preloaded version of it.\nMm-hmm.\nBut then we put it to market.\nLook, let's just say that the app is 99 cents or free to download, right?\nAnd then there's a free $5 tier, $10 tier, $25 tier.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd you could do a family plan, you know, however you do stuff like that.\nOr a classroom plan.\nYou know, you could pay X money a semester to have X number of students.\nAnd then every student just needs to buy their token to this app.\nYeah, yeah.\nSo then like, and I'm just spitballing here, but like let's say that a teacher pays X dollars to upload all of their content and 75 chairs.\nAnd then every student is required to buy their chair.\nSo let's just say for the class we charge a grand.\nI think we can charge more, but a grand.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd then the students are required to pay into the token to use the product, and then it expires at the end.\nMm-hmm.\nIt's a subscription-based platform where teachers can control it.\nYeah, the simple way to do it is to simply require the content for the class.\nOh, yeah, definitely.\nYou have to buy this token to be in the class.\nYeah.\nBecause otherwise they don't get all their points in order to get their grade.\nAnd I mean.\nThen they have to buy it.\nNow whether they use it or how well they use it determines what their grade is.\nYou know, I remember the first time that I used Duolingo.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd I didn't download it for school.\nI downloaded it just because it was like fun to learn in a way that resonated with me.\nMm-hmm.\nI sit and I do my Swedish and my Japanese lesson every night.\nMm-hmm.\nNot because I have to, but because I want to.\nIt's gamified.\nIt's fun.\nMm-hmm.\nInternet culture surrounding it.\nMm-hmm.\nYou know?\nSo like what if we restructured the Nell beta, like let's finish the Nell beta just for\nmy own personal edification.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd because I think it's valuable.\nAnd then we restructure it into a vertical app.\nYou know?\nAnd we, I mean, I.\nOkay.\nSo what would that look like in Intro to MassCon?\nSo I'm going to draw it for you.\nSo I think calling it Miranda is the most tongue-in-cheek because it's the Rector.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nNo, that's good.\nSo we call it Miranda.\nThis is the vertical app, right?\nMm-hmm.\nWhat do we need it to do?\nSo you've already preloaded all the textbooks.\nThis marker sucks.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nMost markers should be thrown away.\nThat's fine.\nWe have all the content.\nRight?\nYour content.\nMm-hmm.\nMilestones.\nYeah.\nAnd we use the AI to analyze that, pull out what the important concepts are.\nOutline it, gamify it, and then feed it to each student.\nMake levels of achievement.\nSo like let's say that Intro to Mass, how many weeks is a semester of 15?\nMm-hmm.\nLet's say that there's three levels a week, so there's 45 levels, and then there's five\ntasks.\nThere's 50 activities you have to do.\nMm-hmm.\nThe final project is teaching the agent.\nYeah.\nBased on how well your agent is trained, or you're training the agent throughout.\nBased on how well your agent is trained, that's your grade.\nMm-hmm.\nMaybe we don't need a picture.\nSo like it would literally, like where's an app that I like?\nSo even just like, here's, we'll continue with Apple.\nOkay, whatever.\nI do have to go through a bunch of stuff.\nBut even like this is gathering data.\nWhat do you believe is the key to realizing your potential?\nMm-hmm.\nMotivation probably.\nSo that my gender, we won't have a non-binary option.\nWhat's my goal?\nIncrease productivity.\nHave a successful career.\nBoost intelligence.\nWhat's my focus right now?\nSelf-discipline.\n15 summaries, that's fine.\nWe'll do a seven-day streak.\nAnd which one is this?\nHeadway.\nMm-hmm.\nWhat do I like to find new ideas after my morning coffee?\nGreat.\nWe'll do it at that time.\nIt's going to give me a reminder now.\nI really enjoy reading books.\nYes.\nIt's hard for me to finish.\nI value self-growth but lack motivation to find time for it.\nYes.\nI believe that personal growth should bring pleasure, not struggle.\nYes.\nNow it's gathering all this data about me.\nChoose three titles that I've read or interested in.\nWe'll say that and biohack your brain.\nGreat.\nSo now it's matching me with content.\nDo you find it challenging to pick?\nYes.\nBut this isn't using AI.\nThis is just an algorithm.\nRight.\nDo you want to?\nYes.\nSometimes.\nPicking content.\nJust going through.\nDo you like to?\nYes.\nIt's trying to like.\nWhatever.",

self-growth.\nThis summary of thinking fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman is about to begin.\nEnjoy.\nKey point one.\nControl your thoughts.\nControl your life.\nYour brain is lying to you.\nLet that sink in for a moment.\nActually, it's not lying.\nIt's just deceiving you.\nBut you could argue it's the same thing.\nNow your brain isn't doing this to harm or upset you.\nIt's trying to help you conserve energy.\nOverthinking is exhausting.\nSo your brain assumes that making assumptions will be far less taxing.\nAnd it does all of this based on your thoughts.\nIt's a good strategy in most cases, but it can affect your ability to make sound judgments.\nAs humans, we subconsciously use several factors to make decisions.\nIllusion, availability, and experience.\nWe even use our gut or intuition.\nA lot of the time, we do this to try and solve a difficult problem.\nSo like, just this, I'm already bored because there's not an activity.\nA quick and effective way to figure out a situation and make a decision.\nBut does it always lead to the correct choice?\nIntuition can be a useful tool, but it doesn't follow logic.\nStrong decisions are based on facts.\nAs a master of his trade, Kahneman's knowledge of behavioral economics, cognitive thinking,\nand psychology has put him among the best.\nHe teaches how to train your brain to-\nAnd they have to license content.\nRight.\nNow you need to become a decisive master.\nLet's jump in.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nThe advantage.\nWe have content.\nWe just need to repurpose the content.\nSo like, and like imagine like if it did like, okay, it's reading me that on one side.\nOn the other side, there's a game I can play.\nMm-hmm.\nAt the same, on the same screen.\nYeah.\nAnd it's a simple, just like puzzle task, nothing distracting, nothing with more words.\nMaybe they can choose one.\nYeah.\nThat kind of, I don't know, you have some variety of like this or this or this.\nAnd like making little games is such an easy thing to code.\nMm-hmm.\nYou know?\nWe just find ones we like and mimic them.\nMimic them.\nYeah.\nMake little apps.\nWatch a video, play a little game.\nListen, play a little game.\nDo this task, play a little game.\nMm-hmm.\nWould that be the, that would be the presentation of the data then?\nDo we want to do the Socratic question answer thing?\nWell, I think that that would be like really cool.\nLike if we could just have the Socratic thing and get turned on and you have a conversation\nwith the AI.\nAfter that.\nYeah.\nAfter you've gone through the content.\nSo like let's just say, okay, there's 45 modules.\nMm-hmm.\nDo you have 45 lessons at the end of every five?\nMm-hmm.\nInstead of maybe you have a check in with your agent to train it.\nYeah.\nAnd then you have your Socratic conversation.\nCause then when they come to class.\nMm-hmm.\nThey could break off into Socratic groups.\nI don't want to do that.\nOkay.\nI have too many students.\nMost of them are online.\nOkay.\nBut yeah, then you do it online or.\nWell, I like the teach it to an agent part.\nI think that that.\nWould that be the third thing?\nSo you.\nSo then like, okay.\nYou get the concept.\nYou go through the concept.\nLet's look at.\nLet's think about normal school.\nMm-hmm.\nThere's lecture, homework, quiz, test, project.\nMm-hmm.\nLecture is now this game.\nMm-hmm.\nHomework is, I mean, I don't see anything wrong with there still being like notes or a worksheet\nor something like that.\nJust like a modernized version of it.\nWhat about the game thing that's going on while they're listening to something?\nWhat if you could also include like just a scratch pad just to draw something?\nSo then like, let's say that this is done on an iPad or.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nLike you're required to submit or I mean.\nIf it is.\nIf it is, they can.\nWell, hear me out.\nWe like go back to Dr. C's key takeaways.\nMm-hmm.\nThe homework is simply, what are your key takeaways?\nOne, two, three, submit.\nOne, two, three, submit.\nMm-hmm.\nOne, two, three, submit.\nBecause then that could be sent off to the Socratic agent to help them.\nMm-hmm.\nBecause like, let's just say that one of their key takeaways is wrong.\nThe agent knows to gently help them learn the concept correctly.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd then we have lecture and homework taken care of.\nQuiz would be the Socratic method.\nThey would sit down at the end of every five and have a conversation with their agent and discuss and build their comprehension.\nWell, the quiz was kind of the takeaways, right?\nNo, quiz would be the homework.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nWe're building towards the Socratic method.\nOr perhaps...\nOkay.\nWrite this.\nWrite this now.\nYou're writing Socratic questions.\nMm",

together and you can see the unit the ai delivers it to you at the end\nbecause then you get this like this cool achievement of like oh this is everything i\nlearned this is what your agent knows right like you could maybe even save your agent into the app\nto quiz it later or to use it to review later that's kind of like how i structure it yeah\nand so like you know duolingo has it like here's one and you're going to two and you're going to three\nfour like you can see the map here's johnny\nand johnny is x percent done\nand this structure perfectly mirrors the lizzie project architecture it just a dumb not dumbed\nbut like it's a simplified version of it yeah yeah because we're doing short form writing\nhowever the long form writing would come in handy when you're making the scripts\nyeah of what it's reading\nright and that's where we get the\nwe pull the concepts or definitions or whatever the main things are that we care about\nthat the socratic needs to we structure that with the nell architecture\nbecause nell is long form miranda is short form\nso then you know we're you we're perfecting the nell architecture building this we don't launch\nnell until next year right right but we can launch miranda\nand this is miranda miranda holds your hand yeah begin yeah the beginning of it yeah\nthat's probably more functions than we can get done\nin six weeks you never know like look because this is this entire architecture is inspired by\nmy thesis right the bones are done we're just restructuring the code and we have ai that understands\nthe code like i'm going to transcribe this conversation and give it to the ai later\nokay like all we have to do is one of these a week and we have more than six weeks we have eight\nall of june all of july and really the first two weeks of august\ni do right you can take time off but like i'm the lead engineer yeah right and i've got to teach\nthat class the existing way which isn't that hard in july and august so like you know how to do that\nand like you know we get the funding perhaps part of my job is to be in the class you know or i lecture\nonce a week whatever helps you and helps the project thrive yeah well we can go through the\ntext that's in these chapters you know we we save a lot of time because we have the lizzie architecture\nwe have the nell architecture and we have clean data right we spent all of last summer on data\nwe don't have to do that anymore because it's all in markdown well we're not doing a film book but\nwell and we'll still do the film book in the background where we're doing the nell research\nwhile we're testing the miranda project\nyeah because this is going to be applied to any topic this this could be applied to any one of the\nopen stacks books like instantly yeah the hardest part of any of this is the data science now i'm\ngetting better at it every day i can by the end of the summer i'll be an expert\nnow and this is where i would pitch it to bill poucher this is the problem set thing that they want\nyeah and so i would literally tell poucher and be like we can do this\nas long as icpc isn't selling it i wouldn't mind donating\nyeah yeah the architecture in exchange for funding and a salary right because you can sell it to other\npeople but they can have like a free license for life for anything i develop you know because\nhonestly like after being there like i want to support these kids yeah they're awesome yeah yeah\nthey are but do you want to say funny what's innovative so other people will do socratic method\napplied to content okay i think we need to do it too but that's not the that's not the key to making\nthis work work well if the key to making it work well is fitting into this mindset the scroll and how hard\ndo you want to work and so on as a as i think that likes proxy for\nwhat students used to do in class just have to write something i would say take an exam right so\nthis is in place of writing but they are writing uh yeah exactly they're teaching the agent which means\nthat they're thinking harder than like yes right exactly and then i think it'll be really rewarding\nfor them at the end to get their agent and be like whoa like i really did all that and it's like\nencouraging we're only giving you positive reinforcement yeah yeah your bu books ratings are about to\nskyrocket you're welcome\nright because you can just have the agent because look at the icpc problem archive\nit's all public yeah i know we just do this to the problems oh you want to do 2018\nthere's only like 15 a

would just call it icpc go so and i will write this up for you but i would propose\nand i know i'm beating the dead horse but like just formalizing the thoughts proposed to poucher\nthat he funds our lab he gives me a salary you some money in exchange he and we'll set this up as\nan llc or whatever he gets free access for icpc use only to anything we develop forever um\nin exchange for helping us get this going because then and frederick him all of them are in waco\nso like we can sit down and work together yeah we we can make a um\num miranda 501c3 which makes it easy easier to work with baylor and so it could just be an llc\nthat then or it funds the miranda project at baylor but it'd be better if it was like a foundation\nlike voucher's thing so it's like this is totally controlled outside we near icpc there i mean he did\nit right he's brilliant yeah so we can do you know what gets funded here and so\nthat's my perfect world because then it gives me the room and you the room to do this as long as we\nwant while doing our other things i can go work at amazon i can go do another startup i can do\nwhatever i want i can do a startup that funds the miranda project but i mean like all my roads lead\nback to the miranda project that's what i want yeah yeah i think poucher would be more interested\nin this than anything we've ever done yeah because the pitch to him is we're making this agent you're\ntrusting that we're going to do it yeah have them make the agent that solves these right and in order\nto do that we'll do it the tick tock way the subway surfer way the we give them that option if they\nwant to kind of clear the deck and just go code directly with claude or whatever fine but\npeople are going to play with this app may like to be doing minecraft and this well and frankly all\nof this work also works towards me getting into the media lab yeah because this looks great yeah for\nthe media lab especially if it's an icpc product it does so that's how i pitch it to poucher i can\ngive you a one pager to read to him yes do that let's uh come up with a list and this is maybe luke\ncan contribute or peter to contribute uh favorite games favorite fiddle fiddle games i don't necessarily\nthink it matters what the game is as long as there's like six options yeah i know let's get\nbecause like i think like because people are going to ask well like what i don't play games\nthat you know some people are and you're going to say yeah yeah yeah exactly like that because we\nwe've looked at all these um and these are appropriate\nand for people who don't know we've got some examples and it's just one of the things that we want to be able\nto have the answer to an app is brilliant like kudos on that that's the way to do it and i just\nnever thought of it this way until it was presented yeah but like some some hybrid of the lizzie project\nand headway that's the thing to do it\nyeah now that frederick would eat this up the thing with uh an app on apple is selling it they get\nwhatever 35 percent or something well we wouldn't sell the app would be free yeah we would just have\nthe buy-ins buy the content yeah we would have a free version and then paid tiers\ni'm pretty sure they get 35 of that too can we do it through android yeah or just it's on the web\nthey'll just do a web service because then people can use it\nit yeah i like that well because pathright pathright is a web delivery platform got it\nthey've done a good job of making it work real well on mobile phones\nso i think we want it to work within that somehow we have to that's why we might have to talk to\npathright and figure out well i mean like even you think about it like okay we get this going for the\nfall you charge your students 20 how many students do you have uh last fall i had 440. i charged them 60\ni mean even if we charge them 30 that's 13 000 right there yeah i know we charge them more because\nwe added features so then yeah then like you get some money i get some money and we have some money\nto go back into the miranda project yeah you got to run some um you know what the overhead is what\nbesides the fact i had the right material nothing pathright oh no pay for pathway how much a hundred\ndollars a month\nyou see why i like that platform yeah\nyeah so then our next so we might need to host some things and there's an ai but it's not going\nto be crazy expensive because we could train this all on for a mini as long as this gets is it under\na hundred dollars it should be fine yeah it will be because yeah they're paying five fifty five hundred\nfifty six hundred dollars for the course\nand they're still like honestly i would be thrilled that i only had to pay 50 bucks and i get ai\nyeah yeah and be able to play the games you",

that my friend sarah worked on yeah\nand it was just like i guess he's really rich and his parents like bought him all this equipment\none of those yeah and i guess it was like the most disorganized like i guess he had like this massive\nshot list he wanted to get and you know everyone helping on the sets fdm and they're like this is\nnot going to work like we do this and he's like no no we're gonna get we're gonna get it we're gonna\nget it no was he from the business school when he's doing a film have you seen this kid's stuff\nhe is such i'll send you his linkedin he's the biggest try hard\nokay i hate those kids who their daddy bought them an expensive camera so they think they're\ncinematographers that's what he thinks yeah yeah and like his stuff looks okay but it's just like so\nsad like how he colors it is just like\nyeah do you think that this is something that like john valade would potentially be interested in\nhelping with if poucher falls through depends on what happens with 6p but we'll see okay i can't\nimagine poucher being against this considering he was already open to like donating well you can give me\nthe um some examples of what games you know the elevator pitch and the whatever joel knows how many\nslides you can have on a pitch deck i don't know what it is but it's like just\nit's the longer version basically poucher the hook for poucher will be the problem set the problem set\nand giving this as an option for students with the icpc go to play the problem well and even like i\nthink of like okay peter could download icp like it's a way to like get kids into it peter could\ndownload icpc go yeah they just have to write simpler problems to bring in elementary kids and\nmiddle school kids which is called icpc kids yeah boom exactly icpc kids is now like a after-school\nactivity yeah while they play minecraft while they play the more games we can make it compatible with\nthe better we can supply the games fiddle games but eventually well yeah we partner with mojang in\nthe future yeah mojang x icpc go or just figure out a way to split the screen well i mean like on my ipad\nyou can already split screen yeah so could you do that let's find out if i can do with headway figure\nout how many games you can do that with like here's headway yeah crap no it doesn't it doesn't some\nit's not supported on certain games so we just have to make sure that split screen was supported\noh yeah so we make games that could do that or we just yeah like on a phone it'd be vertical\nlike here's my new york times game yeah and spotify\nhere's netflix and\ndoes not let you do that so are we going to be playing audio are we going to be having them\nread or i would say a little of everything okay i think this is true multimodal\nai yeah there should also be a leaderboard\nokay like you can choose to opt in like if you're not competitive don't do it but like you can opt\ninto the leaderboard because then like think about it for icpc it's a global community yeah\nand you can chat like eventually we could add a i don't want to monitor all that right now\nright but we just do a discord server you know you can join icpc go discord link your discord play\nthe leaderboard and chat and then anything crazy that happens is discord's problem we're just linking you\nto the discord server\nyou know but like in peloton one of the reasons that i like it is because i can compete i can\nchoose to compete i can turn my leaderboard off but i can always see like everyone else that has\never done the ride that i'm doing i can see where i rank so let's say that they're doing problem b\n2013 you can see everyone that's doing it on icpc go how fast you did it i'm wondering how i could do\nthis in the classroom how could i i teach in a classroom that has three screens the two on the\nsides are independent of the main one in the middle just put a video up a video or i could have assigned\nstudents to play a game on one side or the other it's a key worker yeah they can compete your class\nyour contribution to the class today is to play minecraft on the screen for the whole hour and 15\nminutes while i'm doing my lecture and then everyone else can watch him play yeah yeah because i'll still\nban cell phones but i'll let them compete for the right to play a game that's kind of fun i like that\ni think that'd be cool be really fun yeah because then even if they're just zoning out watching the\nother kid play minecraft they're passively getting more of you than they ever have before yeah yeah\nor like you can just have two kids competing well because we're using up the extra bandwidth that\nthey'd be like not you know using to not pay attention to what make them watch this kid build\na house yeah and then they're this is the only other input right where you're filling up the bandwidth\nso they can't be more overstimulating them positively yeah it's it's the same technique i as soon as people\nstarted coming in with uh their earbuds in that's when i started playing music loud for",

technique i as soon as people\nstarted coming in with uh their earbuds in that's when i started playing music loud for the first 20 minutes\nbefore class so that they couldn't mute it out so yeah so they can't listen to their own music they're\nat least everybody's listening to the same music it's almost like hypnotism like not really it's like\neverybody's on the same page and i can comment about the last song when i start the class and link it to\nthe class somehow that's brilliant yeah okay well i can't do that anymore now because now they come in\nwith headphones on or earbuds and they're just willing to crank up the earbuds and they're soundproof\nor whatever whatever yeah right so i was like so i'm kind of frustrated but now i can have them\nplay a game or even like like okay fruit ninja i love fruit ninja you give the kid an ipad you\ngive the other kid an ipad you're competing in fruit ninja now yeah and for and that's what you're doing\ntoday that's fascinating okay we can have them suggest games or even you hook up a ps5 yeah you know yeah\nlike right and i like i like this because it's the same thing we're doing in the app really okay even\nlike think about like okay you know like the wii four kids get to play wii bowling yeah during class\nwell we could even just four kids get to play mario brothers or it could just be twitch channel\nthat's a good idea okay just and we could stream the classes live and try to get media attention\nyeah once once we get some validation we're gonna get some this is this is cool this supports\neverything everyone else is doing but it's one step cooler which is what we always want to be yeah\nget ahead not even okay so this is because this works for the online kids\nwell they could just twitch into class yeah and maybe they'll want to come to class\ntheoretically yeah that's true they could they could just link in\nwell and also like you get cool like okay i just want to be able to do the class in some way\nthat coming to class well your class automatically also like kids will talk about this\nlike people will be yak yakking about your class yeah yeah you know\nyeah we do a twitch channel you never know what what i want is just people playing games you might end\nup with some edits of you on yeah line but yeah oh you could just do that just record something\nand play them back i feel like we could build this in 10 weeks yeah i think so web web based\nweb apps are so much easier too so it'll run on the phone so okay it needs the code for web delivery\ndelivery that conforms to the screen okay but almost everything does that now\nyes i need yes the hardest part of this is you need to be able to split the screen for vertical or that\nright yes so above or side by side if it's we also need to figure make sure like what's the load that\nit needs to hold yeah server load blah blah blah blah this is fascinating and it's a perfect evolution of\nthe work that we did with lizzie it's almost like a step back that launches the slingshot because this\ndoes well we get some money and then we we launch nell in 2026. yeah well who what other\ndo you want to do that yeah definitely this could be a pr thing well then we need to formally launch\nin the vault like we just think next steps yeah i have to be able to set this up so i can commit to\nit for the full semester well i mean that becomes my job yeah you know yeah well i'll have a ta assigned\nto me too they're not worth anything respectfully true true they're like what do we need them for\nuh well we can have them clear content and so on if we need to record things or set up\ni don't get why you don't get one ta for the whole time like why don't they want you to\nbuild a relationship with one kid well normally i do just recently not\ni really just want to be around to like watch their thesis films\nyeah i can't wait well and see doing this\nwe might be able to frame this as some kind of graduate school\nresearch independent study and education hey right i just want the stupid hat man like\ngive me the hat yeah when i get that bonnet i hope you know that i'm going to wear that every\nday for the rest of my life catch me in my bonnet\nyou're going to wear your regalia to every class you ever teach doctor yeah i used to do that how\nsilly uh okay just the bonnet everything else is heavy okay i like this i need to think through all\nthese details a couple times but i'll send the transcript to you i'll get you a one pager for\npoucher we just need to like hope and pray that poucher's on board yeah i think yeah the thing will be\nselling selling him on the icbc go yeah it's like kind of a tick tock version of icbc go\nright it's a it's an it's a training app it's a play the game do the thing if you want to if you\nwant to just do the problem fine and it reinforces their concept of a global community because you can\nbe playing this anywhere in the world you get to know the other competitors you can get on

traction females that was the other thing i was floored and\ni'm not a feminist but it was like thoroughly disappointing how few women were there it's\nit's choice it's like the it's the classic uh it's not in fact poucher will tell you the women in icpc\nare rabidly against dei oh yeah it hurts them yeah it makes it's like hey i work for this yeah no i'm as\ngood or better and when the girls that are there are fantastic yeah i just like i talked to all of\nthem you know because like it was just interesting to hear about it but like i mean i would love for\nthere to be more women representation not in a dei way but just in like uh yeah we wish more were\nattracted to it and stuck it out through the whole computer science program but i also like understand\nthat like it is a more fundamentally male field just like we're not rooting for more men in interior\ndesign yeah jordan peterson uses the example of sweden right what country is more feminist egalitarian\ndei than sweden they can't get any right and what percentage of nurses in sweden are female and male\nno idea it's way dominated by females how many are engineers dominated by males it they choose it\nyeah and they all have a free choice they all have the same basic you know education the same\nopportunities and that men choose this women choose this and i mean like nine times out of ten like you\nare more fundamentally wired to do it social workers female yeah\nhow many nurturing men do you know\nnot it's not high on the list no right yeah okay\nbut this would definitely how many gamers are female tons yeah\nhalf roughly hit roughly okay so\nthat could get more women to choose to continue computer programming computer science gamify it from day one\nwe would need to get the app high on the app store too\nyeah how did how do they actually work with the app is it just they get the problem and they have\nto what app my app no the the icp the existing icpc or what they want they intend to make i don't\nthink they have one oh okay there isn't there you know my biggest takeaway from being there is all of\nthese processes are 40 years old i think that's why i'm so valuable i think that's why taylor watson\nis so valuable i think there's like\ni think having people 40 and under working for that foundation\nis the best thing they can get right now like i think that even though i don't have a traditional\nbackground i'm immensely valuable to the foundation\nbecause of how i think because of how i streamline processes because of how i organize processes\nbecause of like my vibe coding and how quickly i can fix a problem you know they they told me to\nwork on facial recognition 24 hours later i had a prototype and it was working it wasn't great yeah\nthere was room for improvement but i did something i had never done before simply because of the\nworkflow that i've achieved and i feel like for their photos yeah yeah i did i built a photo tagging\napp it's not very good but for team photos it's perfect yeah it 100 nails team photo tagging\nand it writes all the metadata which helps the photographer yeah yeah did that you know it showed\nup you said fix this problem i did it hire me because i can do that for less complicated things\nbecause that was probably the most complicated thing yeah no that's very good so i think that i'm\na massive asset to both the miranda project and icpc and so yeah we gotta find out what frederick's\ni'm gonna text him monday because i wanted to pass along some info that i had um but fundamentally i\nthink that having me at the face of these two things because i am a woman yeah and that's what\npeople like you know i still you know brick house would say i'm dei having me be the face of this liaison\nsituation right it's a smart move you know um and then ultimately i'll just become the product\nmanager of the miranda project i'll have engineers under me yeah you'll be whatever you want to be yeah\nyeah yeah um but yeah i mean we have funding at baylor through the summer right we just need to get\npoucher to pay for the fall yeah well i hope because for the summer tips in for the summer too\nhow much like what do we have like a note like what would we need to fund this well i if i have to\nto fund things through june that's what i was thinking and hoping we've got to get something else\nafter that okay\nsomehow either somebody contributes more to the fund i have act funds i have access to or\npoucher needs to come up with something directly or maybe we can think of something else is there\nanything this is i mean if you need to find out if poucher if the foundation is paying frederick for\ni don't let me look up his linkedin or he's just i think this is just a loose idea right now okay\nthat they want to bring to life\nthey just want to organize the problem set well they're already organized they just need to be\ninteractive i don't quite understand what they want he's a consultant um he's the director of

what for doing sports for engage supporters attract\ncreators and drive revenue by centralizing all your sports media in one place oh that's cool so you\ndoes that he does independent independent consulting\nand he's the direct i don't think he's getting paid at icpc right okay\nbut find out um we need to find out what um apps there are for learning coding so\nbut we're not technically teaching coding we're teaching strategic problem solving\nyeah i know that um but if you want a kid's version it needs to teach it needs to teach\nproblem solving at a simpler level so just like scratch do that right yes okay so it's drag and drop\nto do figure out the it's kind of like what brilliant would do brilliant would teach it\nuh programming by having you drag and drop stuff yeah okay so we want to do something like that only\nmuch more sophisticated level we don't want to start with the kids one but we can always work backwards\ndown to simpler i'm just starting from the basic\num what we're suggesting in the short term is okay yes with the problem set why not\nimprove engagement and attracting people to look through the problems\nthe problems by having this kind of game thing going on at the same time\nmaybe you combine it with\num\ni don't know if they have this kind of content i wish\nyou know what they should do after the contest is they should interview they should interview the\nteams i was talking about that i said they needed a podcast yeah it's like interview the teams and\nhave them explain how they solve the problem and i need to talk to lydia about that too right and then\nwhen you call up this problem set you have somebody you have the option of somebody goes through how they\nsolved it or this team solved it like this here's how and they talk about it while you're watching\nsubway surfers and looking at the code and i have a lydia and i are having like a two-hour debrief call\ntogether i'll record it or you can have professors do it say okay here's here's this and here's how the\nteam did it here's how long it took them here's how many tries that failed and then they got it on the\nfourth one whatever so play by play let's think breaking down of like you know what do we actually\nneed to keep this going we need funding obviously yeah um i can serve as the head engineer for a\nwhile yeah the the icpc thing is the is really the hook to maybe get some funding the primary project\nfirst would be the class because we've got but then coucher can watch it yeah because we can show\nhim see see how this works and we're going to apply this some of these techniques maybe not all of them\nto the icpc problem set and we're going to enhance it with other types of content like the interviews of\nthe teams after they solve the problem or you know here's this famous alum of icpc well and then it\nhooks back into the fact that they want help in live they call it live not media is we automatically\nhelp script content better for it yeah okay so the chief scientist at openai quora uh two-time world\nchampion university of warsaw got it okay have that person do like a a guest critique of the winning team's\nsolution they need a podcast i was telling them this because if they recorded a podcast that's\ncontent that you can chop up any way you want and nerds will listen to it yeah yeah they've got all\nthese alumni they just go through the list and even like okay give me i'll like i'll host the podcast\nbecause ai can write me the script i'm just more personable um\nthen yeah let's try to have funding by july 1st yeah i'll focus on getting this as far as i humanly can\nand then lord willing we'll launch the miranda project at baylor yeah um it'll be my formal role\nand jackson will serve as proof of concept that we have students working on it yeah\ngreat can't wait to put co-founder of the miranda project at baylor in my linkedin\nmiranda kind of awesome need to find out if we can do llc\nnonprofit for profit you can do for profit is joel interested in playing with this too\nor is he's brainstorming he's brainstorming but i think um i think he might\nsee the potential well and just in like helping with like development stuff really is what i would\nwant from him\ni have my call with him on friday yeah he's trying to keep kind of a low profile and uh\ni would just like love any additional help i could get with like solving problems as this\ngets bigger and bigger and bigger you would not believe the place they're staying in who joel and\nkaylee where are they staying malibu are they doing in malibu living in a house that's like hangs out\nover the ocean at night the tide comes in and it's underneath the house that's awesome yeah it's a\nhe's trying to keep a wealth profile so i won't tell you who's house but\num yeah yeah crazy so am i going to california that's the other thing i need to talk about with\nhim uh july 2nd i think he doesn't tell me this well i just it seemed like he said

going to stay there for like\n10 days after because i have friends in california i'm just going to leave from san francisco and go to\nla my best friend lives in la yeah yeah that's good um well hopefully by then too we have like a\nformal partnership yeah i'm going to try to find out if there's a competent person in the education\ndepartment and just kind of tell them we're going to be doing an educational related app i have a\nquestion then because i already have a master's degree how many more years would a phd take me\nif it's from baylor well i would i would think two years and write and then write the dissertation\nso two years of work in the dissertation yeah but if we do it right you pretty much have the dissertation\ndone in the two years writing up what the work you did as the dissertation the thing the trick would be\ngetting me as your lead person when i'm not in that school so it might not be possible might have to\nhave another chair but i would you'd be the chair i'd try to direct yeah so then building on\nso the question then would be would it be better to have the europe post grad and co-founder of this\nmiranda company miranda project at baylor does research for miranda\nuh and that on your resume gets you into mit here's the thing that would be faster i wouldn't\nit's this weird balance of like the media lab would be cool do i need it not if miranda ticks off and\nso that's why i'm like you know i i want the phd so that i can get into academic reform when i'm\nolder and it makes crap like this i want to be able to teach as a full professor if i wanted to\ntenure i never want to and this is no shade to cassie but i never want to end up in that position\nand she has a phd yeah yeah i i want that full option and if there's like a way to do it easy\nthrough baylor while i am young yeah see give me the stupid hat and let's keep going you know right\nwhat you want to do is you want to be successful enough that you just go in and say give me tenure\ngive me tenure or i'm leaving create a a position with the title that's equivalent yeah yeah okay so\nso your existing tenure track people are going to about you coming in and getting tenure give me the\nequivalent of tenure i want the same same deal can't fire me you know and the title that's equivalent\nthis is a lot of good pieces moving i feel like we can get poucher to land the ship yeah i'm gonna\nactually\ni'm gonna see i can't have breakfast i have a doctor's appointment at 8 15 on monday i open milk\nbottled on monday i can't eat anything before that so i'll have to try to get poucher for tuesday okay\nfor breakfast i'll tell him look working on this thing this educational thing where we're trying to engage\nthe over stimulated you know but use that as a way to and i'm willing to reshape this a little bit to\nmatch what he wants oh yeah yeah like i'm gonna i'm gonna frame it as the thousand brains i also\nlike i had so much fun i don't want to like potentially burn like i want to keep doing this\nand if i like once i have a lot of if i ever have a lot of money i would still volunteer like that was\nso fun yeah like it was a kind of like fun that i was so i i had never he was like\npoucher was telling me he's like you know you've been treated like an adult before but like this is\nlike the first thing you're ever doing where you're actually an adult isn't it because i graduated before\nand i'm like oh yeah i guess it is and it was like very strange to like get to go and like function in\nsociety as a human not associated with baylor and do cool stuff with these people that are really\nsmart yeah did you ever watch the all-in podcast will used to talk about it all the time okay well\ndon't let that put you off why did he get that did you you saw his pr i caught it everywhere\nthey play poker they play poker all the time like chamoff will like take fly to vegas and\nplay these high stakes that's what christian because he has so much freaking money christian\nlimb that's what he's doing right now yeah him and i don't know if you've met them him and his wife\nare hilarious no they are hilarious like as a couple yeah together like we're all sitting at the table\nbecause we're on our screens christian's off in the corner because he doesn't want anyone to see his\nscreen and just like over here on his computer grace is laughing at him very serious and he's\ngrace he's this is my favorite hand this is my favorite hand\nokay it was funny anyway so yes dr poucher i am much more\nconfident in this idea in terms of pushing it
