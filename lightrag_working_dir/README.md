### ðŸŽ­ Plays Bucket (Download Required)

- **Status**: Too large for GitHub - download separately

## How to Get the Missing Buckets

The `books` and `plays` buckets are too large for GitHub's file size limits. You have several options:

### Option 1: Contact the Developer
Reach out to the Lizzy Alpha team for access to the complete knowledge buckets.

### Option 2: Build Your Own
Create your own knowledge buckets by:
1. Adding writing craft books to `books/` directory
2. Adding plays and dramatic works to `plays/` directory  
3. Running LightRAG processing to generate the vector databases

### Option 3: Use Scripts Only
The system will work with just the `scripts` bucket, though brainstorming will be less comprehensive.

## System Behavior

- **With All Buckets**: Full AI capabilities with 18,000+ story entities
- **With Scripts Only**: Reduced but functional AI brainstorming
- **With No Buckets**: System works but without knowledge-enhanced generation

The brainstorm module will automatically detect which buckets are available and use them accordingly.

## File Formats

Each bucket contains:
- `graph_chunk_entity_relation.graphml` - Graph structure
- `kv_store_*.json` - Key-value storage files
- `vdb_*.json` - Vector database files

These are generated by the LightRAG system and contain the processed knowledge from source materials.
